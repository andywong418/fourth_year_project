            Falling U.S. used-car prices will drive up new-car incentives

[]

 The U.S. auto industry will have to offer more discounts to maintain demand as prices for used cars decline. ..With auto sales recovering from their recession-era slump, the industry's supply of used cars has started to rise again, driving down prices. ..This in turn will pressure new-car prices and raise the stakes for automakers, which have enjoyed the new-car sales renaissance of the last 4-1/2 years...To achieve annual sales above pre-recession levels of about 17 million new vehicles, "the automakers are going to have to increase incentives more," said Larry Dominique, executive vice president of research firm TrueCar Inc. ..TrueCar estimates used-car prices will drop 5.2 percent by 2017, while new-car incentives, now at about $2,700 per vehicle, will rise about 11 percent over the next two years to nearly $3,000. The National Automobile Dealers Association forecasts a nearly 7 percent decline in the average used-car price to just under $15,000 in 2016 from $16,025 in 2014. ..Meanwhile, new-car prices are rising because of the popularity of pricey features and more-expensive vehicles. They hit an average of $31,262 per vehicle last year and are expected to increase another 2 percent both this year and next, TrueCar said...U.S. new-car sales averaged 16.7 million vehicles annually in the decade that ended in 2007, but they skidded to 10.4 million in 2009. Demand rose at a double-digit pace in the three subsequent years, increased another 8 percent to 15.6 million last year, and is expected to top 16 million this year. ..Many of those cars, especially the ones coming off three-year lease deals, will be resold as used...Dominique said the average age of cars on the road, now topping 11 years, would creep down as newer-model used vehicles enter the market...Not everyone agrees...Pete DeLongchamps, vice president of U.S. dealer Group 1 Automotive Inc, said that while used-car prices would continue to drop, pent-up demand for new cars remained strong because so many people delayed buying during the recession..."There will be some shift in pricing, but I don't think it's enough to affect the market," he said. ..Group 1, which derives most of its earnings from parts, service and financing, sold almost as many used cars as new ones in its latest quarter. Still, used models accounted for only about 13 percent of gross profit, compared with almost 20 percent from new. ..Industry officials said still-high used-car prices had room to slip without significantly hurting new-car demand. .."This is a long-term, regular cycle," NADA analyst David Wagner said, "and not a bubble."..But while the auto industry, including U.S. automakers General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co, largely refrained from dramatically increasing profit-sapping incentives after the recession, experts have questioned whether that will hold given pressures the companies will face to increase sales and maintain share as demand growth slows..."As the wholesale prices decline with respect to new vehicles, clearly it's a negative," said Tom Webb, chief economist for wholesale car auction company Manheim. "You can get in somewhat of a downward spiral."..

 "The Used Car Price Index: A Checkup and Suggested Repairs"
http://www.bls.gov/ore/abstract/ec/ec010060.htm

[]

.......... (2001) "The UsedCar Price Index: A Checkup and Suggested Repairs."..The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has published the    used car price index since December 1952 as part of the    Consumer Price Index (CPI). As its 48th birthday approaches,    the used car price index merits a timely review for at least    two reasons. First, compared to the new car price index, the    used car price index is akin to an ignored stepchild,    receiving less scrutiny but deserving of more attention.    Second, there are nagging doubts and misgivings within the    BLS about accuracy of the used car price index. The    questionable behavior of the used car price index could be an    undesirable byproduct of the sampling procedures adopted by    the BLS. Or, could the source of the price information that    the BLS relies on be the culprit? What role has the treatment    of quality improvements played in explaining the suspect    behavior of the used car price index? While any or all of    these could be the underlying causes of the questionable    behavior and should not be slighted, could the observed    "excess" volatility of the used car price index be    a real phenomenon? Used car markets might have less elastic    supply curves and experience larger demand shocks compared to    those observed in the new car and other durable good markets.    This paper addresses these questions. Among the findings are..?..July 19, 2008.. ?|? .. ?|? .. ?|? .. ?|? ................

https://www.valuepenguin.com/average-cost-of-insurance

We examined the average cost of car insurance by state to help you figure out how much you should be paying in premiums for a policy.

ValuePenguin researched and crunched the numbers to get you the average cost of car insurance by state. Use our data to see what your states average premiums are to get a better idea of what you should be paying for insurance...The average annual cost of car insurance paid in the United States was $907.38 in 2014 according to a study commisioned by Quadrant Information Services. This figure will vary wildly state to state and does not always include all forms of coverage and may not be accurately reflect your coverage needs.?Scroll through the table below to find the average cost of car insurance in your state or use the form to find a cheaper quote for auto insurance:..Data from various states' Departments of Insurance show that annual car insurance premiums are on the rise in the majority of states across the nation. The average cost of insurance for car owners of insuring their vehicles from accidents and other events has generally increased, with the exceptions of Arkansas, Georgia, North Carolina, and Virginia, who all saw their car insurance premiums drop between 1% and 5% in the last year. These quotes for automobile insurance in select states across the country should give you a ballpark estimate for average annual car insurance...Auto insurance quotes will vary significantly depending on the age of the driver or applicant. Young drivers are notoriously more dangerous behind the wheel and because of that, insurance companies charge higher rates on policies covering young drivers. The chart below will show you how drastically car insurance quotes fluctuate based on your age. Each dollar amount in the graph below represents the average annual cost at that age...If you're interested in reading more about how your age affects your car insurance rates check out our?....Amongst those drivers that have had no violations or accidents within the past 3 years, auto insurance rates are fairly similar with the exception of young drivers. Our data, which looked at rates from 54 different insurance companies, showed that 19 year old male drivers paid an average of 12% more in car insurance premiums each year over their female counterparts. Why is this the case? While gender is not a direct ratings factor that insurance companies look at, the data behind the gender shows that men tend to drive more often, receive more speeding tickets, be involved in more accidents, and receive more DUI convictions than women!..The average cost of homeowners insurance throughout the United States is $978 per year. Take a look at our table below to get an idea of how much it costs in your state:..Home insurance is designed to cover homeowners in the event of any unforeseen catastrophe that damages their home. The average cost of home insurance will be influenced primarily by the location of your residential property and the extent of your insurance coverage. Several types of home insurance are common or typical to specific regions or locales, such as damage to floodwaters, hurricanes, earthquakes, etc. As a general rule, the Federal Reserve Bureau says you can estimate the expense of homeowners insurance by dividing the value of your home by 1,000 and then multiplying that number by $3.50. Using average home price data from AARP, here are some typical annual homeowners insurance prices from around the country, ValuePenguin has constructed a table for your reference...If you're one of the millions of Americans who have forgone buying a house in exchange for renting a place, you may want to consider renters insurance as a way to protect your personal belongings. Renters insurance protects your studio, walk-up apartment, or elevator apartment against events such as destruction of property from fire, vandalism, and theft. Looking at some of the average costs of renters insurance in our four representative states, ValuePenguin thinks the monthly premium is cheap enough and worth the peace of mind knowing you can at least recover the cost of any lost or damaged items...Health insurance is an important investment to make in oneself, family members, and loved ones. According to eHealthInsurance's 2011 Annual Insurance Survey, the average monthly premium for individuals in the United States was $183 (or $2,196 per year). Furthermore, the average monthly premium for families was $414 (or $4,968 per year). ?Between 2010 and 2011, average premiums increased 9.6% for individual policies and 5.6% for families. ?The average cost of health insurance ranges between $119 in Iowa and $382 in New York. ?ValuePenguin's table has a few examples of average annual premiums for individuals and families in select states to give you an idea of the average cost of medical insurance.

Annual Cost to Own and Operate a Vehicle Falls to $8,698, Finds AAA | AAA NewsRoom
http://newsroom.aaa.com/2015/04/annual-cost-operate-vehicle-falls-8698-finds-aaa-archive/

Lower Gas Prices Help Fuel 2 Percent Decline From 2014

ORLANDO, Fla. (April 28, 2015) ? Due to declines in gas prices and finance charges, the annual cost to own and operate a vehicle has fallen to $8,698, a nearly 2 percent drop from last year, according to AAA?s 2015 ..study.? This research examines the cost of fuel, maintenance, tires, insurance, license and registration fees, taxes, depreciation and finance charges associated with driving a typical sedan 15,000 miles annually. In the United States, a driver can expect to spend 58 cents for each mile driven, nearly $725 per month, to cover the fixed and variable costs associated with owning and operating a car in 2015...?Fortunately, reduced gasoline and finance costs more than offset rising costs in other areas,? said John Nielsen, AAA?s Managing Director of Automotive Engineering and Repair. ??As a result, car owners can look forward to saving approximately $178 this year.?..$6,729..$8,716..$10,649..$9,372..$10,624..$0.449..$0.581..$0.710..$0.625..$0.708..?..Compared to last year?s study, the average cost of regular unleaded fuel fell nearly 13 percent to $2.855 per gallon. This decline, coupled with improvements in vehicle fuel economy, resulted in an average 11.21 cents-per-mile fuel cost. ?Due in large part to this decrease, the cost of owning and operating a sport utility vehicle is slightly less than that of a large sedan this year...With rising car sales and stiff competition among dealers, many manufacturers are offering low finance rates to attract buyers.? In 2015, average vehicle finance rates dropped 21 percent, which equates to approximately $15 per month on a typical five-year loan. However, rates vary widely with borrower credit scores...The single largest ownership expense, depreciation, rose for 2015 due to increasing new car sales that are causing an influx of used and off-lease vehicles entering the marketplace. This increased supply has resulted in lower values and selling prices for used vehicles, thus driving up depreciation costs...Insurance rates vary widely by driver, driving habits, insurance company and geographical area. AAA?s calculations are based on low-risk drivers with excellent driving records. While premium calculations are confidential, this modest increase of $7.67 per month may be due in part to high-cost modern vehicle features such as infotainment systems, advanced safety features and lightweight materials that can be more expensive to repair and, therefore, insure...Annual maintenance, including labor time and repair part costs associated with factory-recommended maintenance, was factored into the 2015 survey along with average costs of an extended warranty.? Maintenance costs varied widely by vehicle type but, on average, were up slightly from 5.06 cents to 5.11 cents per mile. A .. of AAA-Approved Auto Repair shops found that the majority of drivers are behind schedule in routine maintenance, including oil changes, tire maintenance and battery inspection/testing...Vehicle prices rose modestly in 2014, contributing to an overall increase in state and local tax costs.? Additionally, some states increased fees related to vehicle purchasing, titling, registration and licensing...Due to the competitive and dynamic nature of the tire market, tire costs in 2015 remain relatively unchanged, rising by just .01 cents per mile...In addition to calculating the driving costs for sedans, AAA determined annual costs associated with both minivans and sport utility vehicles. Owners of these vehicles will benefit from annual driving costs nearly four percent lower this year, at $9,372 and $10,624 respectively, due to lower gas prices and finance rates...?When shopping for a vehicle, smaller isn?t always cheaper,? cautioned Nielsen. ?A minivan, for example, can carry up to 7 passengers, yet costs $100 less to own and operate each month compared to a large sedan.?..AAA has published ..since 1950. That year, driving a car 10,000 miles per year cost 9 cents per mile, and gasoline sold for 27 cents per gallon...The .. study employs a proprietary AAA methodology to analyze the cost to own and operate a vehicle in the United States. Variable operating costs considered in the study include fuel, maintenance and repair, and tires. Fixed ownership costs factored into the results include insurance, license and registration fees, taxes, depreciation and finance charges. Ownership costs are calculated based on the purchase of a new vehicle that is driven over five years and 75,000 miles. Your actual operating costs may vary. See AAA?s 2015 .. brochure for a list of vehicles and additional information on the underlying criteria used in the study...As North America?s largest motoring and leisure travel organization, AAA provides more than 55 million members with travel, insurance, financial and automotive-related services.

Get paid online, no subscription fees...Compare rates from the nation's most trusted LTL Carriers...We purchased a 1968 Firebird on ebay and needed to have it shipped to Montana from South Carolina. I decided to try uship. I ended up with 3 bids and chose the one I thought would be the best for us, taking into account feedback and pricing. I would definately use this service again. I also had an independent bid (not from uship) and from what they were going to charge compared to what I paid from USHIP, we saved $550. The car was picked up on a Thursday and was delivered on Monday. We were happy with USHIP. ..It was getting close to Christmas, I had bought a truck off e-bay and needed to get it home. Could not find a shipper on my own that would bring it in a short time. A friend recommended uShip so I put it out there. within a couple of hours I had a private owner operator bid on the job and he was great. He went above and beyond to get to my vehicle, load it, and have it to its destination before I expected it there.  ..uShip saves you time and money by quickly connecting you with auto shipping providers. Transporting your car, truck, or van is easy with uShip. Start by entering the make, model and year of your vehicle above and clicking the yellow "continue" button.

First, you will need to use up as much of the fuel in the tank as possible in order to prevent any safety hazards, so give your vehicle one last ride before transporting it. Next, if your vehicle is leaking fluids you should let the transporter know so that the fluids don?t drip onto another car or cause a fire or safety hazard...Coolant and oil are very slippery substances and could cause harm if not properly noted by you and your carrier. Lastly, clean out all of your items from the car and make sure that any loose items/panels are secured. It is also wise to take photos of all sides of the car just prior to shipping and note any pre-existing damages...Is your car exceptionally low?

How to Approach Rebates When Negotiating Car Price
http://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/1000_cash_back

Learn what researchers at Kellogg have determined about how rebates affect negotiating car price and the implications for both customers and dealers. 

The faculty of the .. bring their latest research and expertise to you in an accessible, engaging format. ....?....Based on the research of.., Jorge  Silva-Risso and ....As automobile manufacturers are painfully aware, certain models experience slumps in sales. Inventory piles up, forcing manufacturers to find ways to stimulate sales. What are the options? In the United States auto manufacturers often turn to rebates, cash subsidies paid for each transaction. The two most commonly used subsidies are payments made directly to customers??customer cash? in industry lingo?and payments made directly to car dealers?called ?dealer cash.? Which one works better? New research by Meghan Busse (Associate Professor of Management and Strategy at the Kellogg School of Management) and Florian Zettelmeyer (Professor of Marketing at the Kellogg School of Management) shows that the answer is not quite as simple as it may seem...Putting money directly in the customer?s hands may appear to be a sure way to lower the price the customer must pay the dealer. After all, every dollar the manufacturer gives the customer is a dollar the customer does not have to take from her own pocket to pay the dealer...But there is a catch. ?Prices for new cars are negotiated between car dealers and new car buyers,? Busse explained. ?If a dealer knows that the customer is getting $1,000 from the manufacturer, the dealer may be able to get the customer to agree to a price that is $100 or $200 more than the customer would otherwise have agreed to pay.? As a result, the customer would still pay $800 or $900 less than he or she otherwise would have, but part of the rebate would go to the car dealer...This might seem to weaken the allure of customer cash, but, as Busse points out, the effect cuts both ways. ?If the manufacturer instead gives $1,000 to the dealer for every transaction completed, the dealer could pass along several hundred dollars to the customer in the form of a lower price in order to persuade the buyer to close the deal,? she said.....This research, published with colleague Jorge Silva-Risso (Associate Professor of Marketing at the University of California, Riverside) in .., finds that both car dealers and customers gain from manufacturer rebates, whether the manufacturers target the rebate to customers or to dealers. But determining who benefits most depends on which form of rebate the manufacturer chooses...The researchers analyzed sales of more than 133,000 new cars sold in California from September 1998 through December 2000. Roughly 15 to 20 percent of the state?s new car dealers were represented. They studied the type of vehicle, the negotiated retail price paid by the customer to the dealer, the wholesale price paid by the dealer to the manufacturer, the value of any trade-in vehicles, and the dates and types of sales promotions. They also incorporated demographic information about buyers, such as education and income levels, and dealers, such as geographic region and the amount of local competition...As is often the case when studying ?real world? phenomena, the researchers had to clear some methodological hurdles. In particular, they needed to disentangle the roles of price and promotions.....?The promotions may not be independent of price. There may be an overall price trend that leads manufacturers to offer rebates,? explained Busse. For example, an overall weakening of certain economy-wide features may cause sales to plummet, leading manufacturers to pull out all the stops to revive business. ?To distinguish the impact of the promotion from the overall trend, we used a method called regression discontinuity, which is used a good bit in labor economics, but not so much in work like this...?Basically,? she continued, ?we looked at tiny slices of time, one week immediately before and after promotions began, changed, or ended. We compared the average prices during those two periods, which are so close together in time that the only major, discontinuous difference is in the promotion.?..The average negotiated retail price paid for a car was $25,490. Customers received cash from the manufacturer, an average of $1,242, in 26 percent of the sales. Manufacturers gave cash to dealers, $932 on average, in 18 percent of the sales...When manufacturers offered cash directly to customers, the prices customers paid for their cars were lowered by roughly 70 to 90 percent of the rebate amounts. For example, a person given $1,000 cash by Ford when buying a new Taurus ultimately paid roughly $700 to $900 less than a person who did not receive any cash when buying the same kind of Taurus in a similar market...But when manufacturers offered cash to dealers, customers only received roughly 30 to 40 percent of the benefit. That same $1,000 from Ford, when offered instead to the dealer who sold that same type of Taurus, would only lower the price the customer ultimately paid by $300 to $400.....The practical implications of this work for the car industry are clear. ?From a managerial point of view, what?s the most effective promotion, push or pull?? asked Zettelmeyer. ?Give a supermarket shopper a coupon to encourage them to buy, to ?pull? the product off the shelves, or give a supermarket owner a discount to encourage them to sell, to ?push? the product off the shelves? For car manufacturers, both approaches stimulate sales in the wholesale market. But while customer cash is more effective at lowering prices, dealer cash may be used to help influence sales for a particular dealer who?s not doing so well.?..As the researchers point out, however, the work has implications that extend beyond the car industry. One of the key distinguishing features of buying a new car is price negotiation. In negotiations, economists (as well as many buyers and sellers who have had to negotiate a purchase) believe that little things can make a big difference to the outcome. One of those ?little things? is having an information advantage...?Customer cash and dealer cash set up a very interesting comparison,? Busse says, ?because they are so similar in almost every way.? The key difference is that customer cash is heavily advertised, so that both the dealer and customer know that the manufacturer rebate is part of the deal. But only the savviest customers will have investigated whether dealer cash is available. ?As a result, dealers have an informational advantage when manufacturers offer dealer cash rebates?only they know just how much money is on the table?while in negotiations involving customer cash rebates, both parties are equally well informed,? Busse concludes...The effect of such ?asymmetric information,? as economists call it, on the outcome of negotiations is something that has often been theorized and tested in experimental settings. But there has been little testing in real-world settings with large stakes. The research suggests that there may be many situations?buying a house, negotiating a salary, making a business deal?in which a slight advantage in information can lead to a big advantage in the outcome...Why we don?t always choose our favorite option..Let?s face it: few of us relish navigating politics in the workplace. Even the phrase ?corporate politics? evokes power-hungry managers...............Associate Professor of Strategy ..Nancy L.

The Evolution of Price Dispersion in the European Car Market
http://www.nber.org/papers/w6818

[]

  ..........Car prices in Europe are characterized by large and persistent differences across countries.  The purpose of this paper is to document and explain this price dispersion.  Using a panel data set extending from 1980 to 1993, we first demonstrate two main facts concerning car prices in Europe:  (1) The existence of significant differences in quality adjusted prices across countries, with Italy and the U.K. systematically representing the most expansive markets; (2) Substantial year-to-year volatility that is to a large extent accounted for by exchange rate fluctuation and the incomplete response of local currency prices to these fluctuations.  These facts are analyzed within the framework of a multiproduct oligopoly model with product differentiation.  The model identifies three potential sources for the international price differences: price elasticities generating differences in markups, costs, and import quota constraints.  Local currency price stability can be attributed either to the presence of a local component in marginal costs, or to markup adjustment that is correlated with exchange rate volatility; the latter requires that the perceived elasticity of demand is increasing in price.  We find that the primary reason for the higher prices in Italy is the existence of a strong bias for domestic brands that generates high markups for the domestic firm (Fiat).  In the U.K. higher prices are mainly attributed to better equipped cars and/or differences in the dealer discount practices.  The import quota constraints are found to have a significant impact on Japanese car prices in Italy, France, and the U.K.  With respect to local currency price stability, 2/3 of the documented price inertia are attributed to local costs, and 1/3 to markup adjustment that is indicative of price discrimination.  Based on these results, we conjecture that the EMU will substantially reduce the year-to -year volatility observed in the car price data, but without further measures to increase European integration, it will not completely eliminate existing cross-country price differences...

Used Car Values: What's My Car Worth? | CARFAX
https://www.carfax.com/guides/selling/whats-your-car-worth

Thinking about selling your car? Let CARFAX guide you through the process and help you attract used car buyers.

 By Jim Sharifi         ..        ..        .. So you?ve decided that it?s time to get a new car, and you need to figure out what your current car is worth. That can depend on a number of factors, such as vehicle condition and mileage. However, the amount of money that you can get for your car also depends on what you want to do with it. Do you want to trade it in, or is it worth the effort to sell it privately? Either way, we?ve got a roadmap to help you determine your used car?s value, as well as a few tips to help you maximize your profit, regardless of whether you plan to sell it yourself or trade it in. ..When you?re trying to figure out what your car is worth, you?ve got a few options that will help you get an idea of how much you should ask for. A good starting point is to check online sources. You?ll enter factors like your car?s year, make and model, as well as its mileage, vehicle condition, options and trim level...Used car values are also affected by supply and demand, so if you plan to sell it privately, it?s a good idea to search used car listings online. Look for cars that are in your area, and in similar condition, with mileage and options that are close to what your vehicle has. You may see prices above ?book? value if it turns out that demand for your car is high...You?ll be able to get a general idea of what your car is worth using these factors. However, how much you can get for your car might depend on what you plan to do with it...After you?ve done your research online, you may notice that estimates for your car?s value can vary depending on whether you plan to sell it yourself or trade it in. Additionally, you may notice that dealerships are able to command slightly higher prices for the same car. Here?s a look at why similar vehicles command different prices if you plan to trade, sell or buy from a dealership...The price that a dealership can ask, which is sometimes referred to as the ?suggested retail price,? is subject to a few stipulations. Suggested retail prices for used cars are often intended for vehicles that have a clean title history, and it?s expected that these cars have been serviced and repaired as needed by the dealer. Dealer pricing is also a little higher because there are certain costs associated with running a dealership, such as commissions, advertisements and the profit that the dealership needs to keep the lights on. Still, suggested retail pricing is not set in stone. You can negotiate on the final sales price, and factors like supply, demand, mileage and vehicle condition all impact what a dealership can expect to get for a vehicle...When you consider the factors above, it?s easy to see why dealerships may command a higher used car price. So if you decide to sell your car, you should expect buyers to negotiate based on the private party values that you see online. Private party values also depend on things like vehicle condition and mileage, as well as supply and demand. Keep in mind that private party prices are typically for vehicles that are in ?As Is? condition. However, if the factory warranty has not run out, it may be transferrable to the buyer...Dealerships need to make money, and if you plan to trade your car in, there?s a good chance that the dealer will pay less for it than you?d get from a private sale. While that may seem like you?re getting shortchanged, trading your car in eliminates the hassle of having to show your car to prospective buyers. Additionally, trade-in values assume that the dealer will put some time and money into prepping your car before it?s listed in their inventory...Regardless of whether you decide to sell your car privately or trade it in, there are a few things that you can do to help maximize your profit...Start by taking care of smaller problems that are easily fixed, which will show the dealer or potential buyers that your car is properly maintained. Give it a thorough cleaning inside and out, top off your fluids and replace items like burnt out lightbulbs. Taking care of these issues will also give the buyer (or dealership) fewer items to nitpick during your negotiation...If you plan to sell your car privately, you?ll attract more buyers by writing a detailed description of your vehicle. Make sure to list the basics like your car?s year, make and model, as well as any notable options. Remember that a well maintained vehicle will provide car shoppers with some peace of mind, so if you?ve taken care of major repairs, upgraded the stereo or invested in something like new tires, it makes mention those highlights in your used car listing. Is your car garage kept or accident-free? Small details like this will provide even more assurance in your listing, especially if you can back them up with service records or a Vehicle History Report...Car shoppers also love photos, so take as many high quality pictures of your car as you can. Include photos of the exterior, interior, odometer and trunk. Don?t be afraid to include photos of dings, dents or issues that need repaired, either. Showing a potential buyer your vehicle?s imperfections demonstrates that you?re an honest seller. More importantly, a thorough description with detailed photos ensures that you?re not wasting your time, or the buyer?s...CARFAX Vehicle History Reports are based on information supplied to CARFAX. CARFAX does not have the complete history of every vehicle. Use the CARFAX search as one important tool, along with a vehicle inspection and test drive, to make a better decision about your next used car...?2016 CARFAX, Inc.

20 tips for buying a used car ? MoneySavingExpert
http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/car-finance/buying-used-car

Buying a used car will save you bundles of cash if done properly, follow these tips to beat the used car salesman at his own game.

Learn how in the .. | .. | .. | .. | .. | .. | .. | .. | .. | .. | .. | .. | ..For all the latest deals, guides and loopholes - join the 10m who get it. ..By Harriet Meyer | Edited by ..            ..        ....But with murky histories and hard-nosed salesmen, it can be a minefield. This guide is filled with top tips and checklists (we've created printable versions so you can bring them with you) to  minimise the chance of any nasty surprises. .. Please suggest any changes or questions in the .. discussion. ..How much a used car will cost you will ultimately depend on what car you get. Yet there are plenty of ways you can reduce the final bill. ..  The average new car has a list price of around ?28,500. But by the time it's one year old with 10,000 miles on the clock it  costs just ?21,000 ? a reduction  of more than 27% in the first 12 months. In the second year the depreciation rate is likely to slow by roughly half (so the second year, this average car would lose around ?3,750 in value). ..So picking a year-old model will dramatically slash the upfront cost. There are exceptions if you?re picking a plush model. Brands that hold their value best tend to include Mercedes and Porsche - so you won't see too many year old luxury car bargains out there. ..To save you time and energy trying to work this out, car experts have already done this research. You can compare running costs of different models, including the ones you're looking to buy, on several sites, including .. and ... But, follow these rules to home in on the cheapest cars:.. The  choice of a 1.0-litre or a 2.0-litre engine isn?t just about pure horsepower. A large engine will usually burn more fuel than a smaller one.  So engine size is a vital consideration if fuel economy is an important factor  in your decision...Of course, this depends on how you use the car. A small  engine is most efficient when it?s used as intended, such as to pootle around  town. If a small engine is used a high speed, it'll need to work much harder to  keep the car moving - burning more fuel. .. Diesel engines are often more economical than their  petrol counterparts. But don?t be fooled into thinking this definitely makes  diesel a better option. These cars are more expensive, and they usually cost  more at the pump than petrol. We've ..... Switching  between gears is extra work - particularly to those of us prone to stalling at  traffic lights. Yet while automatics                 take some of  the hassle out of driving, they come with a higher price tag...                A manual Audi A3  diesel hatchback, for example, costs ?20,801. This compares to the automatic  version, at ?22,290 ? or a rise of ?1,489. Yet many automatics are more  fuel-efficient than their manual counterparts, as they 'know' the best gear to be in, so you could recoup the extra  cost over time. .. Technology is improving everyday with modern hybrids  coming in all shapes and sizes, from superminis to luxury SUVs. Fuel-economy  and cheap or even zero tax rates make part-electric models appealing, like the Toyota Prius. They also tend to hold their  value for resale... But they usually cost more to buy ? so weigh up the savings... Buyers of the most  polluting cars pay the most road tax. But choose a car (such as the  emission-free hybrid Toyota Prius) that produces less than 100g of CO2/km  and you'll pay nothing at all... An average family-type car, like a Volkswagen Golf, will set you back ?30 a year. See a full list of .. plus ... ..Cars are placed in  groups ranked between one and 50, using research by the Motor Insurance Repair  Research Centre (Thatchem). This is based of a range of info including performance,  safety features, price of a new model and cost of spare parts. The Hyundai i10,  for example, is   one of a handful of cars in group one, and thus is cheap to insure...Check the insurance group  rating of the exact model you have in mind before buying at ...  The higher the number, the bigger your premium is likely to be. It's also worth checking our .. guide to see what the likely  cost is. ..All the above's important, but if you want to nail the absolute cheapest cars to run, here they are (though do note these are all smaller cars):..Source:  Valuation service .. ..Once you've decided what car to pick, now you need to know how to get the best deal. One way to slash costs is to buy at the right time...Dealers have targets to meet, with bonuses up for grabs. Typically, these are based on quarterly sales, making the end of March, June, September and December a good time to buy. They need to shift cars, so will be more willing to negotiate and offer attractive finance packages. ..But, if you're buying from a private seller, there's unlikely to be a good or bad time. Private sellers don't have targets to meet, other than the price they want to achieve. If you're buying this way, keep an eye on prices a few months before you actually buy - if they're heading down, you may want to wait. Heading up, and it's prudent to buy sooner. ..For a quiet time, try to avoid weekends, or the start of the month, just after payday. A dealership crammed with wannabe buyers isn?t a good place to bargain hard...          If you?re buying privately, it?s also worth picking your time when other potential buyers might be away. This could be over Christmas, or deep into the summer holidays.          Think about the style of car too. Summer is when drivers dream of buying convertibles, making winter a good time to haggle for a deal on one...Here are some tips from a broker and a dealer.....Don?t leave it to the last day of the quarter, as once targets are met any deals will disappear...All dealers work to three-monthly sales targets... Most of us try to hit target way before the end of the quarter, we did our best deals in Feb and early March and are now basically done for the quarter...Before you start browsing for the 'one', think about what you really NEED from a  car. There?s no point buying a two-seater  convertible if you?re about to start a family, so work out what's realistic. Ask yourself:..If you need to flog your current wheels, you've two options. You can either part-exchange the car at the dealership, where the dealer gives you a price and knocks it off the total cost of the car you're buying. Or you can sell privately ? where you list the car and get cash from the person who buys it...We investigated how much more you'd get selling your car privately, and a search for the value of several models on Autotrader.co.uk found the  price difference was often 20% more selling privately compared with part-exchange. ..Part-exchange..If you do decide to part-exchange, watch for dealers  inflating the trade-in price of your old car ? making it look like you're getting a good deal ? but at the same time charging you more for the new model. Simply check how much cash you?ll hand over once you?ve swapped cars ? that is the true cost of the deal...Before you start doing your sum you need to decide what car you want. ..You can check out every model online. .., .., .. and .. are among the best sites for research purposes ? and don?t forget the  .. site for tons of online reviews...There are two sorts of costs you need to budget for: upfront and ongoing. Check you've thought about all of the following and budgeted for them:        ..Once you've decided to buy a car, you will of course have to pay for it. You can either pay the whole cost upfront or take out a finance deal. Whichever way you choose, expect to at least pay some kind of down payment before you drive off...                    .. If you've taken a personal loan, or dealer finance, you'll need to factor in repayments  ..              ..Here are some car finance options: ..If you can get a large enough credit limit (which can be difficult unless you buy a really cheap new car), you can buy a new car on a 0% purchase credit card. You?ll avoid paying any interest, provided you pay off the debt before the deal comes to an end...However, there's a lot of pitfalls with this option, which won't make this a realistic option for many...Firstly, many dealers won't accept credit cards. Or, some will accept them, but will only allow you to pay a limited amount on it - eg, Mazda dealers will only let you pay ?1,000 on a card. And, some dealers will accept credit cards as full payment, but will charge you a fee to do so - often as much as 2%. It doesn't sound much, but it's an extra ?100 on the cost of a ?5k car...Secondly, if you're using a credit card, you'll be limited in the amount you're able to spend - not many will give you a limit of more than ?5,000, and most will be well below this... But if against all odds, you are able to use a credit card, remember to keep up minimum monthly payments (if you don't, you could lose the 0% deal), and make a note in your diary of the end date so you can plan how to repay...For more, see our .. guide...If you?re happy signing up for monthly repayments you could opt for a personal loan at a lower rate than dealer finance. But rates vary widely, so shop around on price comparison sites for the best deal. The best are only on offer to those with untarnished credit histories. ..Rates vary depending on how much you're borrowing. Borrow a small amount, for example ?1,500, and you could pay as much as 8% to 15% interest. If you're borrowing more, for example ?15,000, you could pay as little as 3.5%...But, before you go ahead thinking that sounds very cheap, there's a sting in the tail. These rates are what are known as 'representative' APRs. This means that only 51% of people accepted for that loan need to get that rate. The other 49% can, and often do, get given a higher rate...For more, see our .. guide...If you choose hire purchase, you?re simply securing a loan on the car itself. You pay a deposit of typically around 10% of the car?s price and repay the balance plus interest over the loan period. But unlike a personal loan, you won?t own the car until you?ve made the final payment. So you can?t suddenly decide to sell the car without the lender?s permission. ..It also means that if you default on your payments, the finance company will take the car and you won?t get any money back...For more, see our .. guide...Alternatively, you could ?rent? your car through a leasing deal, where you pay a monthly fixed sum and just hand the car back at, say, the end of three years. This option also means no forking out for MOTs or repairs ? it?s a bit like renting a flat. You can use the car, but you don?t own it, so it?s not your responsibility to keep up repairs... It's popular with companies, but can be great for personal use if you've got your heart set on a brand spanking new car that is really expensive. For other cars it can be mega expensive. There are car leases out there that start from ?99 per month. ..For more, see our .. guide...Another way to 'rent' a car is to opt for a personal contract purchase - or PCP for short. It's basically a loan to help you get a car. But unlike other loans - such as a personal loan or hire purchase - you won?t be paying off the full value of the car and you won?t own it at the end of the deal (unless you choose to, and if you do, you'll need to pay something called the balloon payment)... At the start of a PCP deal, you'll be asked to specify how far you'll drive the car each year. It's important to be as accurate as you can, as if you go over the agreed mileage limit, the finance company will charge 7p-10p for every mile you are over. ..Watch out for this, as 1,000 miles over will see you shelling out ?100 at the end of the deal...For more, see our .. guide...

Eg, if you are a youngster who's  just passed your test, you will pay more for your cover. Plus, taking breakdown cover will bump up the cost. New cars often come with a year?s worth of breakdown cover. See our .. and  .. guides for tips on how to cut costs. .. Once the car's three years old, you?ll have to pay for an MOT every year, which costs  ?54.85 (for the test). Use our .. for MoneySaving tips, including getting the test at local council centres, which could save you ?100...               You'll need to get your car serviced regularly, typically once a year, though it varies by model. Servicing ensures it?s safe to drive and keeps the manufacturer?s warranty valid.

Unless you have free parking where you live, or a garage, you will probably have to pay for a resident?s permit. Check your council website to see how much this costs. Consider any costs to park at work if you drive there too, as well as toll charges you may face along the way. ..

There are tons of online reviews on the above sites and forums that will flag any common problems that could mean costly repairs down the line. A common fault such as a broken clutches could cost around ?400 to repair. ..How can you get the best value?..By the time a car is around four years old it?s often great value as its price has most likely halved since new, even though they may have just 20,000-30,000 miles on the clock. So it can be worth narrowing your search to these. ..Remember that depreciation can prove a shock. .. has calculators to work the impact of this out, showing how much a car loses value each year. The older the car gets, the less important this is. But whatever age the car, remember you?re NOT buying an asset that will increase in value, like a house!..Which cars are the safest to drive?..All models must pass certain safety tests, with minimum requirements. .. (Euro NCAP) awards star ratings to cars after testing how much protection they provide passengers in the event of a crash. You can quickly search for a review by make and model...Manual vs automatic - which is best?..This choice is depends on your driving preferences. The Americans love clutchless motors, but drivers in the UK are still divided. Manufacturers typically offer a choice on their best-sellers, so here are some quick pros and cons:..More engaging drive; superior control; cheaper to buy..Stop-starting can be tiring; could be harder to sell on..Smoother ride; no tedious gear shifting; may be more fuel-efficient..Ask all the dealers in your area for their best deal on your second-hand car of choice. If you?re prepared to travel far and wide to find a rock-bottom price, expand your radius. Make a note of the best price, and ask others to beat it. ..You can always go back to your local dealer to ask if they?ll match the best offer. They might be keen for your cash, and happy to offer the same deal. ..Haggling isn't reserved just for backstreet bazaars, it's a dealer's classic skill ? and it?s expected of you, too ? so bargain hard, and play Arthur Daley at his own game. The first rule is that you should NEVER pay the list price of the car - you'd be a fool to hand over the full cost (unless buying online, where your haggle opportunities are limited!). ..Arm yourself with the cheapest web prices and make dealers compete for your custom - What Car? lists a handy .. for all brand new cars.

I ended up with my target trade in, ?2,000 off list price and 2.9% APR on a Ford Fiesta. It was 4.9% APR but they dropped to 2.9% when I walked away. ..If you're buying privately, it never hurts to make an offer. The worst they can say is no. And even if you walk away then, the seller could call you back if there's been little further interest...For more tips, see our .. guide...Some car supermarkets have a no-haggle policy, so check this out beforehand...It's not just about rocking up and liking the look of the car - instead you need to look at everything, from the paintwork to the tyres, seatbelts and headlights. Make sure you follow our nine things to check:..Diesel engines are often more fuel-efficient than their petrol counterparts. But don?t be fooled into thinking this definitely makes diesel a better option.  ..It's possible to pay almost whatever you want for a used car, though you tend to find that diesel cars - even used - are slightly more expensive than petrol. But, where people think diesel is much better value is on the petrol station forecourt. And this tends to be true - even in today's environment where petrol and diesel prices are much of a muchness, ..Let's take an example. A diesel Ford Fiesta can deliver 59mpg compared with the petrol version's 39mpg (both according to What Car's ..) which means that on a 10,000 miles per year basis, you'd spend ?500 more filling up the petrol car than you would on the diesel (this assumes diesel and petrol are both 110p per litre, as at 25 Sep 2015)...However, you need to remember that not everyone will achieve these mpgs. If you're not doing regular, long journeys where the engine's most efficient, then it's unlikely you'll actually make any savings from going for the diesel model. If you just want a car for pootling around town, it's likely a small petrol or electric car will be your best bet.            ..Both offer their own  advantages ? and remember that fuel prices fluctuate, so check these at the time of buying...Petrol is usually cheaper in the UK ..Good for short journeys..Engines are more responsive ? suit ?performance? cars..So before you choose one or the other, check real MPG values from .. and ...

Testing a car isn't just about checking if it feels right. Make sure you follow our 14 things to check. .. Check you?re insured before doing a test drive. If you?re buying from a private seller ask them to take you for a drive if you wouldn?t be covered by insurance behind the wheel.  If you have full, comprehensive car insurance already you may have third-party cover that allows you to drive another car. But always check with your insurer. ..Most car firms have an approved used section, meaning they've checked the cars over before selling them. Dealers often give warranties on approved used cars, and will have made the car look and feel new, with faulty parts replaced before sale. ..So you may pay more buying from a dealer than from a private buyer, but this route often gives you peace of mind about the car, and makes it easier to make a complaint if things go wrong ? which they often can with used cars.            ..If the car turns out to be faulty (and you didn't know about it), you should be able to get a refund, repair or replacement. See .. for more. ..Alternatively, if you?re willing to pay a bit more for peace of mind you could buy ?approved used? from a car manufacturer?s franchised dealer (eg, you buy a Ford from a Ford dealership). This is the most expensive option, but the car?s history should?ve already been checked and it will come with a warranty. .. Be wary of any dealer that displays signs such as ?sold as seen? or ?no refund?. They are sneakily trying to limit your rights, so make sure you check the conditions of sale...How do I find a reputable dealer?..You can check that a dealer is listed as a member of the ... It's voluntary to join, but those who have commit to a certain code of practice which demands particular standards. Look for an established firm and check for online reviews. Also ask friends for recommendations...Some of the biggest names in the motoring business offer used cars for sale online, such as .. and ... These only allow dealers that have met strict criteria to sell on their sites, and cars come with a history check to ensure you won?t get any nasty surprises. AA also offers free breakdown cover for 12 months, RAC for six months...As well as advertising their cars on classified sites to reach the biggest audience, some big dealer chains and car supermarkets have their own websites. These enable you to buy a car without the bother of visiting a showroom ? but be wary of ads shouting about massive discounts. You may get a better deal going privately, and doing your own groundwork.                    .. has eight branches around the UK and no ties to a specific manufacturer. It offers similar services to a franchised dealer, including test drives and part exchanges... has 11 showrooms across the UK.

But beware, you can?t pay by credit card so cannot use this to give you rights under Section 75 if something goes wrong...If you are definitely happy to go ahead and do the deal online, ensure the seller will carry out history and physical checks on cars before you pay...What questions should I ask a dealer?..Buying from a used car dealer might scream ?dodgy? but go armed with the right questions and a large dose of suspicion, and there are bargains to be had. However, trust your instincts. If you reckon a seller is desperately trying to shift a dodgy old banger, walk away. ..Private sales are a case of caveat emptor, or ?let the buyer beware?. This means it?s your responsibility to check the car?s condition and history, and you have far fewer rights if something goes wrong than you do buying from a dealer. That said, it could be the cheapest way to buy a used car...The seller must give an accurate description. But it can be hard to prove if they pulled the wool over your eyes ? so keep copies of the original advert. If the seller describes the car over the phone, ask for confirmation details on email...You can find thousands of private car ads on as .. and ... Even if you reckon the seller is reputable, always check everything yourself...Go to a seller?s home to see the car, not a carpark or station. If the seller offers viewings anywhere other than their home, think again. This could mean they don?t want you to know where they live if there?s a problem. Take a friend or family member as another precaution, and for a useful second opinion on the purchase...The Vehicle Safe Trading Advisory Group (Vstag) has useful .. that might come in handy. .. ..

This will tell you the mileage readings at tests, dates of previous MOTs, and any faults found...Check with the .. that the car?s colour, engine size/number and date of registration match the V5C (log book)...It?s also worth checking the vehicle identification number (VIN) under the bonnet to see if this matches the paperwork...What should I check in the documents?..Here's a checklist:..You can buy all sorts on eBay, but a car? Would you want to risk this? Lots of people do. In fact, .. is one of the most popular places to pick up a used car. ..But if you pay using PayPal its purchase protection does NOT apply to cars ? and neither does eBay?s own buyer protection. So if anything goes wrong, you cannot turn to either to sort it out...So make sure you've done all the .. before you place a bid. ..What is eBay?s protection?..On its website eBay states: ?Most eBay sales go smoothly, but if there?s a problem with a purchase, the eBay Money Back Guarantee assures that buyers receive the item they ordered, or get their money back.? ..This could be that the item isn?t as described, or doesn?t arrive?BUT this doesn?t apply to cars. This could open a can of worms if anything goes wrong...What shall I think of if I want to buy a car on eBay?..If you still want to go ahead, you should visit and test-drive the car and go through the usual procedures of buying privately, rather than just bid in an auction sight-unseen. See the tips for buying privately and go through the same process, and take care...Pay even a penny toward your car on a credit card, and you get powerful extra protection if something goes wrong down the line.  This is because you're then covered by ... ..Provided that the total cost of the car you're buying is between ?100 and  ?30,000, paying anything towards it by credit card  means the card company (or finance company, in some cases) is equally liable along with the dealer if things go wrong.            ..However, this isn't straightforward. Some dealers don't accept credit cards, others charge you for using one. Finally, some dealers will only allow you to pay a limited amount by card (eg, Mazda  allows ?1,000 on a card). So figure out how important this is, and ask your chosen dealer if it can accept cards before deciding how to pay. ..Here?s a Section 75 deposit-only success story to give you some inspiration.....                    I ordered and paid ?15,991 in full for a new car, but before I took delivery, the trader went into liquidation. Thankfully I had paid the first ?100 deposit on my Barclaycard credit card. So I made a Section 75 claim. It took six months, but this week I received a credit to my card of the whole amount, just from having paid the first ?100 on my card.                ..If you opt for finance from the dealer, Section 75 will usually apply. Hire purchase deals are the exception...So, if you're choosing a personal loan or savings to pay for your car, and not the dealer's finance, it's worth using a card to pay at least something. It just gives you that little extra peace of mind if something does go wrong. ..What if I?m buying the car from a private seller?..You probably can?t pay by card. In this case, you will probably pay by cheque, PayPal or online banking. The seller will most likely wait for payment to clear before letting you take the car...However you pay, ask for a signed and dated receipt. This should include your name and the seller?s, along with details of the car, price, and address where you bought...The dealer will probably try to sell you the premium version of whatever  model you've selected. This may include models they have on the forecourt with cruise control, Bluetooth, sat-nav or alloy wheels. All these will bump up the cost, but do you really NEED them? And if so, can you get them cheaper elsewhere?..For example, .. is a free app which turns a GPS smartphone into a sat-nav, with pre-loaded maps, route planning and voice prompts.          ..And then check what the dealer's 'throwing in'. This is usually anything from service plans, warranties and sometimes even insurance. But, always check these are actually thrown in for free. As above (see ..) benchmark a price for the make and model you're after at several used car dealerships - if the price is substantially above this, then it's likely you're paying for the extras in the price of the car itself...But, don't discount their worth. Warranties can save you ?300-?500 a year compared with buying it separately, especially on used cars; car insurance is often this much in a year too. It's always worth comparing how much you'd pay for a version of that car without all the mod-cons. And then making an informed choice from there.        ..Do you need an extended warranty?..The dealer will try to flog you an extended warranty as part of their sales patter, but these can be pricey. You can always buy one when the manufacturer?s warranty expires on a price comparison site. Beware that there?s endless choice and not all are any good, so check the clauses for any exclusions. A good policy will cover parts, labour AND consequential loss. .. ..Make sure you sort out your car insurance before you take ownership of the car. Just like when you buy a property, you must have insurance in place as soon as you've become the legal owner - even if you're not driving it just yet. ..This is because if anything happens to it, it's your responsibility. You might be taking extra care of your brand new car, but what if you get to the first roundabout on the drive home from the dealership or seller's home and someone drives into the back of you? ..It's also illegal to drive on public roads without insurance. So make sure it?s insured before you pick up the car. ..If buying from a dealer, you can ask if the car comes with any insurance. You may be covered for a week (dealers often include this), but if not you?ll need to arrange insurance before driving the car away. So always check before you pick up your car. .. For best deals see our .. guide...Any remaining tax on the car isn?t transferable between owners ? so you?ll need to get the car taxed as soon as you take ownership. You can do this online at ... However, try to buy at the start of the month - if you buy on, say, 25 May, you'll need to pay the full tax premium for May, even though you haven't owned the car...When you buy a used car you?ll be given a bunch of documents, so check you?ve got the right ones before paying up...Second-hand cars are one of the most complained about issues, with Citizens Advice and Trading Standards receiving 10,000s of complaints a year. These are often about a fault, but sometimes the problems are so bad the car needs to be scrapped...If the car had a blindingly obvious flaw when you bought it, you wouldn't expect it to be the car of your dreams. But if you paid a fair price, and the car goes kaput once you get home, you usually have rights - even if it's a new problem.....If you bought from a dealer..If you bought the car from a dealer you have rights under the .. - see our .. guide for more info...The car must be of ?satisfactory quality?, ?as described?, ?fit for purpose?, and last a reasonable length of time. The dealer has broken their contract with you if the car doesn?t meet these criteria...If the car turns out to be faulty (and the fault wasn?t obvious, like an engine problem or worn out clutch), you should be able to get a repair or replacement or refund if these don?t work...If the dealer say they pointed out the fault, did they tell you the full extent of the problem? Say you were told the clutch is stiff but it?s worn through, then they should sort it out... If you return the car within .., then it's up to the dealer to prove the car wasn't faulty when you bought it. After this,  it's up to you to prove the car was faulty at that time. ..You may be entitled to a full refund if the fault is serious, and picked up quickly after the sale and you?ve stopped using the car. If you?ve had the car for some time ask for a partial refund. ..If you bought the car on finance or paid the deposit on a credit card from the dealer you can take your complaint to the ... That is, if you fail get a resolution within eight weeks by taking your complaint to the dealer or the finance company...Alternatively, if you bought with cash or  a loan from the bank, find out if the dealer belongs to a trade association. Go through its ?alternative dispute resolution? process. See .. for more...If you bought privately..If you?ve bought a second-hand car from a private seller, your rights are nowhere near as strong. Essentially, the car is sold ?as seen?. The car doesn?t have to be of satisfactory quality OR fit for purpose, which leaves you on wobbly ground if there?s a problem. It?s really a case of ?buyer beware?...Say the seller says nothing about an engine problem and you buy it, then that's it. Even if the car shudders to a halt a week later, you weren't mis-sold, so have no comeback. Though if they lie to you ? you do. The seller mustn?t lie about the car?s condition or history. This is why it?s vital to ask the right questions. This could mean the seller failing to mention an outstanding major and expensive service issue when asked, a past accident or false mileage. ..If you discover they have misled you, you should be able to return the car and get a refund. You?ll have to prove that the seller did know about the problem though, and that could be difficult...If you bought at auction..Ok, so you have few rights. The useful parts of the Consumer Rights Act might not apply. Auction houses can exclude these, and cars are usually labelled clearly ?as seen? with no claims as to the condition of the vehicle, so check the terms and conditions of sale before buying. Some car auctioneers belong to the .. (NAMA), which has a code of practice...If you bought online, you have additional rights under the consumer contracts regulations. See our .. guide for more info.

Chevy Bolt test drive: Finally, a practical electric car
http://www.mercurynews.com/2016/09/15/chevrolets-bolt-could-spark-an-ev-revolution/

[]

Trending:..I?m charged up about Chevrolet?s new Bolt electric car...Not only is it going to have even better range than anyone expected,.. it?s actually fun to drive, as I found out this week when I tested?a pre-production model. It?s no Tesla Model S, but that?s not bad, because it costs tens of thousands of dollars less...Indeed, the Bolt looks like it will be the first practical EV, offering not only an affordable price, but enough range to meet most everyone?s day-to-day needs. What?s more, the car, which is due out later this year, has the chance to spark the industry, luring more people into electric vehicles while spurring manufacturers to make better ones...?This is a good thing for the EV movement,? said Gabriel Shenhar, a Consumer Reports program manager who focuses on electric vehicles...Chevy shocked the car industry earlier this week when it announced the Environmental Protection Agency has estimated the ... The company had said it was planning to hit a 200-mile target, but few expected the car would go as far as the EPA says it will...The Bolt appears to have gotten the jump on Tesla. The Palo Alto electric car maker sparked lots of excitement and garnered hundreds of thousands of reservations when it... With a 215-mile range and a $35,000 price tag, that car had been poised to be the first practical electric car for the masses. But it?s not due out until next year...To put the Bolt?s range in perspective, the base version of Tesla?s Model S ? the previous long-distance electric car champion ? will only go 210 miles on a charge, according to the EPA. But that car costs $66,000 before sales taxes, fees, delivery charges and federal and state tax rebates, while Chevrolet plans to charge only $37,500 for the Bolt. Tesla offers versions of the Model S that will go farther, but they cost tens of thousands of dollars more...You can find plenty of electric vehicles in the Bolt?s price class. But they offer half its range at best. Take Nissan?s Leaf, for example, which was one of the first all-electric mass produced cars. Nissan is now offering two versions of the Leaf, including one with a bigger battery pack and extended range. That version costs $34,200 ? so a little less than the Bolt ? but it only goes 107 miles on a charge, according to the EPA...The Bolt?s 238-mile range ?is a potential milestone for EVs,? said David Reichmuth, a senior engineer at the Union of Concerned Scientists who researches electric vehicles. ?It really looks like a great leap forward.?..After test driving the Bolt,.. I doubt Tesla fans will..regret waiting another year for the Model 3, because the Bolt lacks some of the Model 3?s expected pizzazz. But if you?re interested in an affordable all-electric vehicle, and you want one sooner rather than later, the Bolt is easily the best on the market right now...Its range alone puts it over the top, of course. Electric vehicles have had to contend with potential customers? range anxiety issues for years now. Those fears tend to be overblown, because most people won?t exhaust the batteries of even the shortest-range electric cars on a daily basis...But their curtailed range does limit how users can drive electric cars and requires them to do more planning than they would with a gasoline car. It can be more difficult for EVs to accommodate unexpected errands or an impulse trip to the countryside...The Bolt helps to relieve the anxiety and better accommodate unexpected trips. A 238-mile range will get you from San Jose to South Lake Tahoe with a few miles to spare; it?s more than enough for the daily commuting and errand running done by the vast majority of people...But the Bolt is attractive for more than just it range. For one thing, it?s a zippy car. Chevy says it will go from 0 to 60 in about 7 seconds. That?s not sports-car fast, but it?s plenty peppy. It?s also quiet and nimble...Chevy is packing the Bolt with many of its latest electronics and technological advancements. It?s got a 14-inch infotainment center display and is compatible with both Android Auto and Apple?s CarPlay. It has a built-in LTE antenna, which owners can use to create a mobile hotspot for tablets and phones. Owners will also have the option to add several semiautonomous features to the Bolt, including lane-keeping assistance technology and automatic braking...The interior of the car is plain and utilitarian. Chevy designed it to maximize the amount of space available to passengers, even going so?far as to install thin front seats to give people seated in the rear more leg room. Despite being a compact car, the Bolt actually has as much interior space as Tesla?s much larger Model S...Its storage space is much smaller than that in the Model S, but is comparable with many of the other EVs in its class, including Kia?s Soul EV, Ford?s Focus Electric and Volkswagen?s e-Golf...And, did I mention it?s affordable? With state and federal tax rebates, it?s priced at less than $30,000, which is less than the average car sold these days...So I?m a fan of the Bolt. It?s not only a cool car, but Chevy has shown what an affordable electric car can be and do. Here?s hoping it sparks an EV revolution... Chevrolet Bolt electric car.... Best-in-class range for an electric car; affordable price with rebates; large 14-inch touch screen infotainment display; support for Android Play and Apple CarPlay; spacious interior; peppy; supports fast charging; available up to a year before Tesla?s comparable Model 3; available optional semi-autonomous features, including automatic braking and automatic lane-keeping..... Pedestrian looking interior; relatively small storage space; can?t be recharged by Tesla?s Supercharger charging stations; somewhat pricey compared to comparably sized gasoline cars.....200-horsepower electric motor; 60 kilowatt-hour battery pack; five-seat sedan..... $37,500 before taxes, delivery charges and processing fee; eligible for up to $10,000 in federal and state tax credits and rebates..... www.chevrolet.com..?..Troy Wolverton writes the Tech Files column and covers consumer technology as the personal technology columnist for the Bay Area News Group.

Audi TT RS review, great but price car | Cars | Life & Style | Daily Express
http://www.express.co.uk/life-style/cars/711623/Audi-TT-RS-hot-property-pricey

THERE is an old argument among estate agents about buying property: should you buy the most expensive house on the most affordable street or the most affordable house on the most expensive street? 

It is a question that will no doubt spring to mind with this, the new Audi TT RS, the most powerful and fastest Audi TT ever produced but, at ?51,800 also the most expensive...Not that you can immediately tell that from the outside mind you. Look closer and you?ll see the large boot spoiler, the twin oval exhaust pipes and the mildly revised front bumper. But overall it?s perhaps not the striking difference you might expect for the 11 grand extra it will cost you over and above the next TT S model.?..Does that matter? Perhaps not but there?s some irony like that house analogy that Audi is pushing the TT further upmarket just as Porsche is taking its new 718 Boxster and Cayman in the other direction, with its four-cylinder turbocharged engine.?..If they weren?t quite direct rivals before, they certainly are now. And with that in mind, Audi certainly has the on-paper numbers to go head-to-head with its German sports car competition.?..Under the bonnet of the TT RS is a new version of its turbocharged 2.5-litre, five-cylinder engine, with a not-inconsiderable 400bhp. That?s enough to get the TT from 0 to 60mph in just 3.7 seconds and on to a limited 155mph top speed, although this figure can be raised by Audi to 174mph if you desire. To put that into perspective, those are the kind of figures to put it on a par with the R8 supercar, not just other small coup?s.?..There?s also the small matter of 34.4mpg average fuel economy and 187g/km emissions, which are pretty good given its turn of pace...However, nothing can prepare you for how the RS feels on the road. Climb inside and there?s not a whole lot of difference here to the rest of the TT range, except for sportier seats and the adoption of the same steering wheel from the R8, complete with a red stop/start and driving mode selector buttons built into the rim...There is also Audi?s signature virtual cockpit display, allowing the driver to change their view from the dials to the satnav. It?s undoubtedly good but we?re still frustrated that it puts the onus on the driver for everything rather than allowing a passenger to set the satnav or even change the radio station...Set off and there?s a noticeably deeper bass note to the exhaust even without the optional loud button pressed. That develops into a much sharper bark as you get further up the rev range, which is dangerously addictive.?..When Porsche has been so openly criticised for its unemotive engine noise with its new four-cylinder engines, this is a perfect lesson in how to do it right. Having said that, it?s hard to concentrate on your aural entertainment when your other senses are being assaulted by the RS?s sheer turn of speed, especially mid range. Press harder with your right foot and the TT catapults you up the road at a pace that initially takes you by surprise, it is so violent...Linked to Audi?s S tronic twin-clutch semi-automatic gearbox (there?s no manual RS available), there?s not much let-up...You flick the right-hand paddle behind the steering wheel to change up a gear and you continue like a missile up the road. It genuinely takes some familiarity to get used to the TT?s outright pace. That?s just as well as that performance does mask some of the RS?s deeper flaws.?..The quattro four-wheel drive system does a creditable job of giving the TT almost laughably high levels of grip but it doesn?t give the driver much information on what the car is doing beneath them, as with the Boxster.?..It?s similar with the steering too which is sharp enough with its initial turn-in to corners but doesn?t boast much feedback to boost a driver?s confidence.?..In short, while fast and highly capable, there?s still something lacking here when it comes to driver involvement or enjoyment. We?d gladly sacrifice some of its outright speed for more of both. While the RS is undoubtedly a car that wins, and indeed demands, your respect it?s not a car to fall in love with and engage with on an emotional level, something you?re more likely to do with a Boxster.?..Audi?s engineers could almost do with spending some time with a 1.5-litre Mazda MX5, a car that boasts less than a third of the power of this TT but is three times more likely to put a smile on your face.?..Perhaps that?s unfair but it is a demonstration of just how good the rapid Audi is at almost every other thing, from its build quality to performance. There is also the small factor of the Boxster and Cayman having shifted a little downmarket, putting this second generation TT flagship under greater threat than it has been since the RS first arrived in 2009.?..For such an enthusiast-driven car, we?d like the option of a manual gearbox too. But the biggest sticking point is that the ?51,800 asking price is more than 10 grand more than the 310bhp TT S, itself no slouch. As good as this new RS is and as far as Audi has progressed as a brand, a TT can be yours for almost half the price.?..We?d prefer the most affordable house on the most expensive street every time and, when it comes to rapid coup?s, that means a Porsche badge on the bonnet...: Audi TT RS?..: ?51,800- ?53,550?..: Petrol ? 2.5-litre, turbo?..: 0 to 60mph in 3.7 seconds, 155mph top speed?..: 34.4mpg?..: 187-189g/km?..: BMW Z4, Porsche Boxster?..: 8/10..------------------------------------------..This might just be a piece of moulded-plastic genius by the boffins at Lego.?..To the untrained eye, its Getaway Racer and Police Interceptor kits are new additions to its Technic range that offer funky looks and a pull-back action movement to allow them to move like some die-cast toys...However, buy both of them and together they combine to make a third larger Extreme Police Racer.?..Even better, the lovely people at Lego have given us three pairs of both sets to give away, so send your name and address on a postcard to: Lego Competition, Motoring Desk, Daily Express, 10 Lower Thames Street, London EC3R 6EN.?..Closing date is September 28...                    See today's front and back pages, download the newspaper,                    order back issues and use the historic Daily Express                    newspaper archive.

Car Negotiation - Used and New Dealer Negotiating Tips | Negotiation Academy
http://www.negotiationtraining.com.au/articles/negotiate-car-deal/

Buying a used car from a Dealer? Don&apos;t get ripped off, read this negotiating guide. Sharing the inside track to help you save money.

....It's sad how most people .. they've negotiated a good deal from used car dealers. The biting reality is that over 90% are ripped off. So don't walk into the car lot until you've read this guide, or your hard earned cash may turn you into yet another dealer victim... You spend your days (and likely nights) studying or working, saving up enough cash to buy a car. The danger is that Used Car Dealers have stacked the cards in their favour. You're walking into the dealers showroom without preparing properly is like walking onto a tennis court to play against a pro. It's time someone levelled the playing field...This guide gives you the inside track and exposes the hidden tricks dealers use to line their pockets with your cash. Fortunately, unlike the tennis example (where you're going to get thumped), preparation can turn the tables and save you hundreds or thousands of dollars on your next car - not to mention earn you free extras. We don't cover car negotiations in our .., but as many clients have asked for car negotiation advice, we decided to share this article...Before you go tearing out to the dealerships, put on the brakes, sit down and figure out what kind of vehicle you ... Forget about what you want. Yes, we must admit, this doesn't come naturally to most of us. Bear with us; you'll be playing into the dealers hands if you don't do this first. Think about what is going to suit you best. There are 4 things you need to keep in mind when choosing the right vehicle:..There are a dizzying variety of makes and models to choose from. These include the coupe, sedan, hatchback, station wagon, SUV, truck, crossover vehicle or hybrid vehicle. The best advice is not to initially limit yourself to just one make or model. Your well intending friends or family may advise you otherwise - sdon't listen! Availability can restrict your ability to negotiate a better price with the dealership. If for some reason you can't negotiate a good deal on one vehicle, you can always negotiate your next best option. Keep your options open. Yes, this does mean that you need to do some research on your favourite types of vehicles...So who's reviews do you believe? Not the manufacturers. They have a vested interest to be overly favourable or for ... Look for independent reviews. If you have a head for numbers, then start remembering the key specifications so that you can compare each choice more effectively...There's only one way to know for sure whether you've found your dream machine. Get behind the wheel and take the car for a spin. The Test Drive will give you the best feel for the vehicle's performance and whether it meets your expectations and needs. Beware dealers who won't let you drive because of "liability issues"...See how the vehicle rides on both city streets and if possible, on the highway. Equally important is to check through the vehicle. Test the seats, knobs, buttons, seating capacity and comfort, and trunk or boot space...DO NOT buy after test driving. Go home and do more research first...Want to show the dealer that you understand his game? Some of these phrases are only relevant to new cars. Learn a few phrases and confidently drop them into the conversation:..The .. is the price the .. sets for the retail value of the vehicle. It's called the .. because it's traditionally been written on the piece of paper you see stuck to the car's window. The sticker price is attached to the vehicle when the car leaves the factory. Never pay the sticker price! Only fools pay the sticker price. Many dealer salesmen will point to the sticker price helplessly and claim it as their sale price. Don't walk away from salespeople who do this - run!...The invoice price is what the dealer pays the manufacturer. The invoice price is where you want to aim your sights...The dealer is in business to make a profit. So the negotiated price you should pay will .. be somewhere between the invoice price and the sticker price. This is known in .. as your .....So whilst you're aiming for the dealers Invoice Price, he's gunning for the Sticker Price - this is normal and is known in negotiation as each side's .....Your best source is through the internet. Many US car buying sites list their .., unfortunately Australian sites don't. The better sites also offer several buying tools. These tools will automatically calculate option/packages and add them to the total cost of the invoice price...The .. is the amount the dealer receives from the manufacturer on every vehicle they sell. The holdback price is usually in the neighbourhood of 3% of the Sticker Price...This is important to remember because the dealer holdback price effectively lowers the dealer's cost below the Invoice Price. The holdback price adds to the dealership's profit. So if you were skillful enough to negotiate the dealer down to their Invoice Price, they would still be making a sliver of profit....In reality, trying to negotiate below the invoice price, leaving the dealer with their holdback price is highly unlikely. Use the holdback price when negotiating. Ask the dealer what their holdback price or percentage is. This will prevent the dealer from claiming that selling near invoice price will prevent him from sending his kids to college...Also known as ... Some car manufacturers will offer the dealership "hidden" cash rebate incentives on new vehicles. The purpose is to promote certain makes and models. How do you know whether your car carries some dealer cash? Some .....Once you've decided on the make and model, next you need to decide what else you want from the car. This includes the colour, packages, options, and offerings.....Some car manufacturer sites also alllow you to search the .. on their dealer's lots from the comfort of your home...Since cars are not the cheapest investment, you want to make sure you're thinking with your head and not your heart when the moment of choice arrives. So if you are the type of person who has in the past been swayed by a salesman into buying something you didn't need, or paid over the odds, then we suggest you take along a friend who is cool headed. Best you talk with your friend before the final "yes" decision. If ..you or your friend are not comfortable, walk out of the dealership and take your time to think through the reasons. Often we get a gut feel that is hard to explain, but proves its value only in hindsight...The availability of the ideal vehicle is not something we should assume to be automatic. Dealerships can only store so many variations of vehicles. Salespeople can search for your ideal car with other dealerships. Or they can make arrangements to get a special order direct from the manufacturer. This process will likely require some patience and time...            If you have the option of negotiating with several dealerships, do so. Call or visit each dealership and ask them if they have a certain make and model. Limit your preferences and only share your "..". Ask them to call you back about the availability of the vehicle. If you discover that several dealerships have your make and model in stock, you're in luck. You will now have the .. necessary to negotiate a better deal. Remember these dealerships are in competition. If one dealership is not prepared to make you a better offer, simply tell them you you can get a better deal elsewhere. There is no greater source of .. than having a strong fall back offer...However, if you can't wait and must have .. car, you can still get a good deal. Remember that for every day a vehicle sits on the dealers lot, costs the dealer money. The dealer is being charged interest on every vehicle sitting unsold on their lot...            The more flexible you can be, the greater your options. The greater your options, the better a deal you'll strike. So consider several variations of the same make and model. As a buyer you will have less leverage negotiating the price if you are inflexible about the options and packages you want...Final word on timing comes from the great suggestions coming through from diggers and other social media collaborators: Sales people are usually targetted on meeting monthly goals. These poor guys and gals earn or lose bonuses (often sizable bonuses) based on little more than the timing of that last car at the end of the month. You're out of luck if they've already made their quota. You're in luck if they are 1 car away. Bonus quotas are usually measured in terms of revenue, and not so much on profit. So provided they make the deal, it doesn't matter much to them whether they make a profit on ..car. Your car will pay handsomely for profit from all the other cars they sold in the month. Yes, this is a gamble. Yes it's worth sniffing out the salesman to see if you can catch a whiff of desperation...On the other hand, if you know a particular dealership has the ideal car, play it cool. Don't show emotion to the salesperson. One strategy to consider is to begin by talking about a vehicle that has options and packages you know the dealer doesn't have in their inventory. Let them think you want the vehicle right now, and you can't wait for them to search and source it. Then reluctatntly give them an opportunity to present an alternative (which happens to be the car you really want). Of course if you're going to be making a compromise, then the salesman should meet you part way. How? By lowering their price or throwing in extras for free...Veteran dealers are trained to size you up, ask you questions, and squeeze all the information they can in order to get you to say "Yes". So be careful. If you're the loose lipped type, then practice being the one to ask the questions. Just because they ask a question doesn't mean you are obligated to answer. Remember that no matter how charming and friendly the dealer may appear to be, it's more important to save money than make a friend of the dealer...Luckily for you, there is a lot of fierce competition between car dealers. Not every dealer will ask for the same price...One obvious advantages to you of trading in your used vehicle, is so you can unload it without the hassle of advertising and selling privately...The disadvantage is you will almost always receive less money from the dealership. The reason? When a dealership is looking at your trade-in, they are calculating the value of the used vehicle based on the .. of the used vehicle. The dealer's wholesale valuation of the vehicle is always less than what you might receive for the .. (the price you could get if you sold it privately). There can be a significant difference between the .. and the .. of a used vehicle. If you think the dealer is giving you a good deal on your trade-in, beware! It's not unheard of for a dealer to inflate your trade-in value just to close the deal - IF you've not shaved their margins...One of the most common gambits that a salesperson will try is to slightly raise the wholesale value on your used vehicle (usually after talking to the manager "to see what they can do for you"). Look out. They will be making up the loss in another area. For example, by increasing the interest rate on the financing or by trying to flog extra options at a premium...            If you've got the time to invest into getting the best deal on your trade-in vehicle, then go to a number of dealerships. Have each quote you on how much they are prepared to pay for your trade-in. Let each dealer know that the price of your trade-in will be a strong factor in your choosing a dealership. Ask the other dealerships if they would be prepared to match or beat your best price...Don't let any salesperson change the price they originally quoted or claw back extras. Either leave the dealership, call their manager, or call them up on their tactic...Too many people lose their lives and loved ones every year on our roads. So please ask questions about the safety options. This can be yet another weapon in your armoury in levering the price downwards. Not every make and model has the ... These include:..If you have the full purchase price stashed away in your bank account, then skip ahead to "Signing the papers". There are 3 options to ..:..Having an abundance of disposable income on hand is the ideal situation. The reason? You won't have to dole out a bunch of extra money for interest, nor worry about factoring monthly payments into your budget. More importantly, by having cash to offer you have the flexibility to negotiate a better price (.., please keep it coming!). Your advantage is in being able to choose whether you want to use your cash to do a deal without delay, or whether you can save more by keeping your cach and taking advantage of the dealers strong relationship with financing companies. Flexibility is too often underestimated in negotiation. The salesperson won't necessarily be more eager to negotiate with you to close the sale right away. So be careful to gauge whether the dealer is more keen for you to use financing or cash, and play it to your advantage. Don't play your cards too soon...One of the two major lures used by many dealerships to draw you into their net is to offer:..Both of these are hooks and can catch the unwary off guard - they're not always what they seem. .. will only be approved for individuals with a top of the line credit rating.

By accepting the rebate now, you will have to accept financing terms using higher interest rates.....Did you know that some manufacturers offer subsidised low interest financing programs through the dealership? These programs are expensive for the car manufacturers. They will in many instances offer a cash incentive to potential buyers who do NOT take up their low financing. Even though a dealership may be offering a lower interest rate than a lending institution, you may be eligible for a dealership cash incentive rebate which you might otherwise not receive. This puts extra cash back in your pocket...The third option is to go through a known lender such as a bank or credit union. Find out from them, whether you can pre-qualify in advance for a loan, what their interest rate will be, and the period of time or term...Every new car buyer should be aware that .. can vary significantly. Not only will the cost vary from region to region but also on the make and model of the vehicle you are purchasing.

Don't blindly .. they spread out for your eager pen. A clever dealer will still try to add to their profit margin, by talking you into last minute extra features. The most common ploys they might try on you include:..Turn these down with a simple "No thanks"...Be sure that you can tell the legitimate charges from the .....Depending on the country where you transact the deal, other charges which might be added onto the overall cost of the vehicle include:..Many or all of these extra costs may already be included in the initial price quoted by the car dealer. As this may not always be the case, it's best that you ask these .. early...Less scrupulous dealerships may also try to slide across costs that are not legitimate. You should vehemently refuse to pay. These prices include:..Always refuse to pay these extra fees. Consider them absolute deal breakers. Advise the sales person clearly and directly that the deal is off if they don't sweep these charges off of the table. Walk away if necessary...As you review the paperwork for your new vehicle, trade-in ownership transfer, and new vehicle registration - make sure that you understand what you are signing. Read all these papers carefully. Do not simply accept the dealers' explanation. If there is anything you don't understand - ask questions...Always do a final last minute and detailed inspection of the vehicle before accepting the keys from the salesperson. Scan the vehicle from various angles and look for scratches, dents, discolouration, or anything else which mars the exterior. Common signs of wear and tear can be seen on the top of the shift stick / gear stick and pedals. If these are worn, then ask more questions about the real mileage. Also look out for any fluid leaks and scan the interior one last time...When you boil it all down, buying a car doesn't have to be a mine field. By doing your homework and research beforehand you can easily negotiate a better price on your purchase. Now that you know the gambits many salespeople typically try, you are better equipped to counter these gambits to your advantage.

First of all, why is it that the most scrutinized and untrusted sales people are car sales people?  Is that just coincidence?  I particularly liked Preston who was very candid about showing customers the door.  I wonder how much business Preston does with that attitude.  Then there was Michael who boldly told us that when we buy milk, groceries, pens, hats, socks, chocolates etc, we don't negotiate those advertised prices as we do with advertised car prices.  Well here's my answer Michael.  When we walk into a store to buy these items if we decide to leave without making a purchase we don't have the cashier or store manager chasing us out the door to ask us why we are leaving or asking us to explain ourselves for not making a purchase.  So if you're going to make this comparison then be prepared to answer the opposite end of that ridiculous analogy.  Can't we just leave if we don't like what we're hearing?

You see, I am a car salesman and I agree that there are many schemes that are used to screw the consumer out of thier money. However, these schemes are NOT controlled by the sales person unless they themselves own the car lot. We all have sales managers that have all the numbers, invoices, and interest rates at their fingertips. So it's the managers that really do the screwing and NOT the sales people. While there are sales people that are really good at their job and can ask the right questions to get a better understanding of what the customer wants, most sales people have to pry hard and long to get any real information from the customer until the buying process has already started. This makes the sales process twice as hard as it needs to be.

You as the consumer can also try telling the truth once in a while yourselves. Dont tell a sales person youre interested in anything if you are not. ".. of .. people found the following comment useful:.."Please read this and then come and buy a car from me... Some points in this are a given in that they are common sense things everyone should do when buying a car, or virtually anything for that matter. What this article doesn't state is regarding used cars, the money that goes into the car to go through a workshop or panel shop if needed etc... It doesn't state that dealers don't actually own these cars until after a certain amount of days, and then when those days are up the dealer has to pay them out, which is not easy for a dealership, even a big dealership!...There ARE rip off merchants out there that get a traded car give a wash and put it on the yard, but the majority actually put the cars through a workshop to get the car up standard (These are good dealerships)...The average car salesman should make more than $40k a year! don't let anyone say otherwise because they wouldn't have a job if that's all the business they can drum up, BUT the average profit on a used car is around 9%, which if you look at a grocery store or computer store the average mark up is in excess of 35%+ then you cant really whinge...Do Your Homework..Be flexible..Don't listen to tools and be talked out of a car if it's a good deal..BUY AT THE END OF THE MONTH".. of .. people found the following comment useful:.."@S.G, you talk about how you work 6 days/50-60 hours a week, equaling $10-12 an hour/$40k a yr. I'm in the military and during exercises, I have worked 7 days/84 hours a week for 3 months straight(1 hour lunch breaks), $6-7 dollars/hour. I fix bombers that are 50 years old through the scorching hot days of summer and the coldest nights of winter.....Do you salesmen, really think you are overWORKed and underpaid? I hate my job, but I signed a contract, it was my decision. Although, I don't like my job, I'm sure there are more jobs that are much worse than mine that pays lower.....If you TRULY think you are overworked and underpaid, you have the option to quit. Finding another job shouldn't be tough, since there just so~ many jobs out there that pays over $10-12/hour for less work than what you do, right? Right.".. of .. people found the following comment useful:.."im a salesman, and have been selling for 5 years, i take the punt that 85% are un-educated and dont have the internet...What you have put up is okay but at the end of the day its the dealership that offers service and warranty to the customers. if they like and trust you they will spend more and buy from you. i do the same when i go shopping.".. of .. people found the following comment useful:.."To the dealers complaining about customers "wasting your time" when following the tips listed:  TOUGH LUCK. IT'S YOUR JOB.  ....1: When I walk onto the lot I get 3 people hounding me, followed by them showing me options which exceed the budget I stated or lack the prerequisites also stated.  You waste your own time by trying to sell me on something you were initially told I don't want.....2: You want the highest price possible.  We want the lowest.  You knew this is how it works when you got hired.  If you don't like it then find a new line of work.....3: It's YOUR FAULT this is even necessary.  When you expect $16,000 for a car but ask $20,000 you create the necessity for strong-armed negotiations.  If you asked a legit price, you'd save us both time.....4: If you think it isn't absolutely necessary for a person to go home and think over their options then you ARE A SCAM ARTIST.  People must always review options in a comfortable environment before any major decision, including car purchases.....5: If customers getting low prices means you can't put food on the table, then turn down the customers offer or find a better paying job.  We aren't forcing your hand.  If you accept the offer then it was WITHOUT QUESTION a fair one. Don't whine.".. of .. people found the following comment useful:.."OMG all these reviews talking about poor poor car salesmen.  Trust me we all feel REALLY sorry for you.  Theives also have families to support but don't seem to try to justify ripping people off like this!  I am sure people are going to go buy a car with the car salesmans family's well being in mind over their own.  Give me a break.  Yes, the car industry is poor right now so they should be willing to negotiate a low profit rather than none at all.  As for Macy's- you poor saps that pay retail are just stupid.  You may not call it a scam but it is...90% of items at Macy's go on sale for AT LEAST 25% off and patient folks can purchase clearance items at close to cost.  If you are content paying retail at a department store...you go right ahead and pay more for a car b/c you pity the salesperson that pretends to be your best friend.".. of .. people found the following comment useful:.."first, i can appreciate your enthusiasm to want to help the uneducated consumer. second, the info that you wrote would be very helpful in buying a new or used car.....especially if the customer wanted to get the least amount of help and deal with the most unfriendly salesmen. amazing. you actually have made the process much much more difficult then it needs to be or should be. i would agree with the idea of figuring out what your needs and wants are in a vehicle first before you venture out to a dealership, tick off salesmen for wasting his valuable time, and then have a bad taste in your mouth from then on. jk. it will only help a salemen to show you what you want. trust me they dont want to spend 5 hours with someone and show them 10 cars and have them go home to think about it. also know your budget. that way the salesmen will only show you cars that will work into your budget. most importantly, salesmen are humans too. they have feelings and famlies. the word PROFIT is not a swear word...remember. if you really want a good deal just go to a dealership with a good attitude and be happy and excited. remember you are getting a new vehicle not getting ten teeth pulled. i pray for you jerks.....".. of .. people found the following comment useful:.."In my experience... it's pretty hard to make sure that I get the lowest price possible because dealers always have more negotiating experience than I do. If you are one of those people who doesn't have the time to waste on visiting dealer after dealer, you should check out Carsala. They have pro negotiators who will do it for you...".. of .. people found the following comment useful:.."For new car purchases, make sure you put in dealer delivery times into the negotiation and if you can include a "delivered before" date. I have been waiting weeks after when the vehicle was promised. I could have easily privately sold instead of trading in and my late model car (my10) is getting older faster.".. of .. people found the following comment useful:.."I would eat you alive or show you the door. Negotiating tips like these make it harder to buy the car you truley like and will be happy with.  TO most people a new car is a status symbol, looks and extention of their personalilies.....THe internet is a good source of info, But the internet never deliveried a car to any of my customers or purchased their trades.  ....See if Vehix.com will print you a check!!!!!!".. of .. people found the following comment useful:.."the article was relitively good and had some good info, however, an auto dealership and the salsmen or women, are as different as a box of super large crayons, in the way they sell cars and why.  Yes the bottom line, as with any other business, or job, is to make a large enough profit to stay in business counting all the expenses involved.  In the case of new car dealers you are talking investments, and therefore payments of millions of dollars to stay in business, a full page ad in any sizeable city news paper is 10s of thousands of dollars not to mention TV and radio.  ..as for the sales men I was one of the best in the world (top %5 5 yrs, and top 2% world wide in a 35 yr. carear) am I living in a palace in the bahamas, no im living on social security like many others. there is no retirement pay in the auto business, they have to make it while they can, and what I haven't seen here is the fact that most car people like foot ball players burn out in 3 to 5 yrs, Are there preditory dealers and sales people?   Yes there are, but the truth is none of last very long".. of .. people found the following comment useful:.."The average car salesmen, work 50-60 hours a week, 6 days a week. The average car salesmen makes under $40,000.00 a year. If you break that down, it is a 10-12 dollar an hour job. Some might say that is not bad, however you do not know what goes on behind the scenes. With the amount of brain damage you go through each day in the car business, it is the hardest money you can ever make. Picture this, you standing outside waiting for a customer to pull up (who hates you before they even know your name,) They spend on average 2-3 hours with you, driving different vehicles, running around the lot, presenting the vehicles and then they ask for a brochure. You did not get paid a single dime, and it's not over! Now you have to go to your sales manager, tell them the customer wants a brochure, then the managers scrutinize you "what did you do wrong?, Why won't they buy today? Did you do this? Did you say that? Than we have the walk of shame bringing the manager over to the customer, putting yourself and the customer in an uncomfortable position, all for 10-12 dollars an hour... And in regards to a comment posted on here, the average car salesmen only sells 2-3 cars per week. NOT 10!!!!  ".. of .. people found the following comment useful:.."This figures tallies well with another link I saw on the web:....http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080426144050AA1hM4H....RRP is about 8-12% over the invoice price.....There is plenty enough profit (without other charges) to look after everybody.....For a 20K car the profit would be about $2500.  ....Half ($1250) can cover the customer costs and half ($1250) pays for  the dealer's costs.....With this the customer can have his 12 month rego and insurance fees paid for.....The dealer gives half his share ($625) to the manufacturer (3% holdback price or 'pack').  The other half ($625) gets split between the salesman and his company.....The company keeps three-quarters ($470) and the salesman gets one quarter for his commission ($155).....If the salesman sells 10 cars per week then his weekly income is $1550.  Over one year that amounts to 70-80K.....I don't think anybody has to worry that the salesman is going hungry.".. of .. people found the following comment useful:.."thank u".. of .. people found the following comment useful:.."I would love to read a truly well researched article on how to get the best deal at the dealership.  This article neglects to mention the salesperson. The salesperson is the one that spends their time and energy getting to know what you are looking to buy. It's the salesperson that suffers when the customer insist on invoice pricing. Where else does a customer walk into a store and insist on paying only invoice - ever tried it at Macy's? Their true invoice price for that $60 blouse is about $2-$6 but no one ever questions that or calls it a scam.  Yes I am a car salesperson. Do I expect my customers to pay full MSRP? NO But I would like to continue in a feild I enjoy and be able to take care of my family. My personal philosphy on how to get the best deal is: 1 Inform me of what you require in a car. 2. Let me know of budget restraints up front- so I don't put you in a car too high for your budget and disappoint both of us. 3. Do not demand a 'best price' or theaten me with going elsewhere, by doing this you have just assured me that I am personally not going to make any money on the deal and that you are wasting both my time and yours. 4.Remeber negotiating is expected - rudeness is not. 5. Just be nice. ".. of .. people found the following comment useful:.."Do your research on line, there are a lot of great resources (autotrader.com, cars.com, kbb.com). Sites like these can get you the invoice pricing.  From there visit a site like priceanddrive.com and place a price a little lower than invoice.  The dealerships actually compete against each other. I agree with the other comments. Always talk in terms of out the door pricing.".. of .. people found the following comment useful:.."I find it much easier to compare dealerships by demanding the drive out price. THis way there are no hidden fees or charges. I can then compare apples to apples.....I normally figure out the car a I want and email all dealerships in 200 miles for drive out price. I saved 2k on my last car for driving 3 hours. Thats $660 an hour. ".. of .. people found the following comment useful:.."To put additional pressure on the dealer, try to time your purchase in the last few days prior to their submission of figures for the current sales quarter. This timing can vary, but is consistent between dealers of a particular manufacturer. Call around prior to detailed negotiation, it can be a question the dealer will be happy to answer.".. of .. people found the following comment useful:.."A lot of car dealerships will focus on a monthly payment, rather than the purchase price. So, for example, if you say you want to pay $300 a month, they will gladly do that - but perhaps for 72 months.....Make sure you understand what you are willing to pay and exactly what the payments will end up being and for how long.".. of .. people found the following comment useful:.."Anyone who is seriously looking for a used car need only go to a brokerage or dealership where there is a "one price" policy. I work for a brokerage selling "off lease" vehicles and we don't negotiate on price 1 cent. Cars are a marketable good, like apartments and gasoline. A good dealer will research the specific market you are buying the car in and price the car he is selling competitively for that market. Not all dealers charge dealer handling fees or filing fees. NEVER BUY NEW!".. of .. people found the following comment useful:.."Got ripped off by a dealer on my first set of wheels. Wish I'd read this first. Thing was he seemed so friendly - guess that it was shallow charm. So the hard knocks school of negotiation slapped me with a bill of $750 (the overcharge)."..Tel: +61 (0) 2 9300 9803 +61 (0) 422 944 237 ABN: 50115245148..Address: Level 25, Aurora Place, 88 Phillip Street, Sydney NSW 2000..?

Fiat trims prices, adds features to fight tiny-car bias
http://www.autonews.com/article/20160915/RETAIL/160919912/fiat-trims-prices-adds-features-to-fight-tiny-car-bias

After a rough 2016 for small cars in the U.S., Italy's puckish Fiat brand is resetting itself for the 2017 model year with lower prices, more content and simpler packages of features within each offering. Fiat is cutting prices in the U.S. by 5 percent to 10 percent on many vehicles, based on examples provided by the Fiat Chrysler Automobiles unit.

0..Shares..DETROIT -- After a rough 2016 for small cars in the U.S., Italy?s puckish Fiat brand is resetting itself for the 2017 model year with lower prices, more content and simpler packages of features within each offering...Fiat is cutting base prices in the U.S. by 5 percent to 10 percent on many vehicles, based on examples provided by the unit of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. The mid-range version of the 500L, dubbed Trekking, will cost only about 1 percent less but will come packed with previously expensive extras -- heated leather seats, a premium BeatsAudio sound system and a 6.5-inch touchscreen with navigation...A key step has been simplifying the offerings: Each 2017 model will have three packages, or trim levels, instead of as many as 10 on the outgoing 500, said Bob Broderdorf, the brand?s North America director. ?Think about that experience online,? he said. ?Think about it in a showroom. Think about what customers go through. And if you?re new to this, you get frustrated? and might stray to another brand...Fiat has had to adapt to a demographic shift among its customers as well as the market?s seemingly permanent preference for light trucks. When the brand returned to the U.S. five years ago, it appealed primarily to well-traveled baby boomers, and its lone, little model had to span as many needs as possible. Now the line includes a wagon, a roadster and a subcompact crossover. And as some of the newness and nostalgia has worn off, Fiat is selling to younger consumers who are looking for something fun to drive that won?t wipe out their budget...Millennials and Generation X account for 45 percent of the brand?s customers, the company said, and the average buyer?s age is 49 -- half a decade younger than for the industry as a whole...In the U.S. auto market, sales of light trucks -- pickups, vans and SUVs -- have outnumbered cars by 3-to-2 in recent months. That presents a challenge for brands like Fiat specializing in smaller models. Fiat?s volume sagged 17 percent to 22,078 vehicles this year through August, more than double the 8.4 percent decline in car sales in the truck-loving, near-record U.S. vehicle market...?They don?t have the right lineup for the current American consumer,? Jessica Caldwell, an analyst with car-shopping website Edmunds.com, said in an e-mail interview. ?For the past three years, light trucks have outsold cars and we?ve seen small-car market share on a downward spiral.?..The shift away from traditional cars is more than just a fashion trend amid relatively cheap gasoline prices, FCA CEO Sergio Marchionne said in January. He said the automaker would stop producing the Dodge Dart compact car and the Chrysler 200 midsize sedan to free up factory space for more Jeep SUVs and Ram trucks...Each Fiat model has an entry level called Pop. The 500 Pop for 2017 starts at $14,995, more than $1,000 less than its original price in 2011. The Lounge edition?s price was cut by $2,000 to $18,395 and the racy Abarth version will be $2,580 less, starting at $19,995. A cabrio top is available as a $1,495 option for the 500...The figures do not include destination/delivery charges.?..A similar three-pronged approach was taken with the other models, Broderdorf said...Josh Towbin, 41, a Fiat dealer in Las Vegas, had no complaints with the previous lineup, but he said he?s excited about the 2017 model year...?It?s kind of surreal for me, to be honest, being here from the inception of the brand, when we just had that one car,? he said in a telephone interview. Streamlining each model?s offering should make it ?easier for stocking and promoting and making sure that we have the right stuff. It makes it easier for the guest.?......25..Shares..Our in-depth authoritative automotive coverage and degree of access from the boardroom to the showroom makes Automotive News unrivaled in the industry.

Land Rover Discovery Sport SUV: Prices, specs, reviews | The Week UK
http://www.theweek.co.uk/73587/land-rover-discovery-sport-suv-prices-specs-reviews

Land Rover's newest car is an up-market replacement for the entry-level Freelander.

Subscribe..Sections..Secondary menu.. 9.. Land Rover's new Discovery Sport is a compact, smartly packaged and well-rounded family SUV. Even though it's the firm's entry level car, it's a much more upmarket offering than the Freelander it replaces.?..This is a small SUV, but it's a unique one. With seven seats tidily packaged into its hatchback-length body, you'll struggle to find a more versatile car for its size. As you'd expect with a Land Rover, it's a high quality car with excellent off-road capabilities. Combined with brilliant on-road dynamics, it's a compelling package ? in 2015 Auto Express listed it as the magazine's compact SUV of the year.?..Offered with a choice of efficient diesel engines, it's a family car with broad appeal. Here are more reasons why it's one of the best family SUVs you can buy:?..The Discovery Sport is a more modern-looking car than to the Freelander 2 it replaces, thanks to the use of some newly established compact SUV design tropes, added to flicks and features poached from some of Land Rover's other offerings...The car is largely based on the Range Rover Evoque and pitched as a more versatile, practical version of the stylish small Range Rover, but with added passenger and boot space... says: "You only have to glance at the Discovery Sport to confirm it?s a Land Rover product", especially with the rounded nose and slim grille at the front and the crosshair-style taillights at the back...The sloping roofline makes the back end of the car appear slightly hunched and sporty, but the Discovery Sport remains one of the most practical cars in its class ? the looks don't really impede on the cabin...It's a longer car than the Freelander 2, but it's sat lower and has a narrower track...However, with the third row in place, the boot is "almost non-existent". Folding the seats away opens up a 981-litre storage space, which grows to 1,698 litres with the middle row folded flat...Family buyers will be pleased to hear the Discovery Sport is a safe car. It's received a full five-star rating in Euro NCAP testing and comes fitted with autonomous emergency braking and a lane departure warning system as standard... says the interior is well made and with controls that are thoughtfully arranged, slotting neatly between the stylish interior of the Evoque and the more utilitarian look to be found inside the big Discovery. However, it could be more biased towards the Evoque's standards, as it doesn't have the sort of flair you'll see in rivals such as the Audi Q5...Chunky buttons can be operated through gloves ? a nod to the car's offroad capabilities ? while a large, rotary gear selector sits underneath the centre console, which slopes upwards into a dashboard featuring a centrally mounted infotainment screen and plenty of storage slots...The Discovery Sport, unlike many of its rivals, is actually a seven-seater. Technically, it's a 5+2 ? the two seats in the boot aren't large and don't come with a lot of space. But the ability to carry seven in a package not much longer than a family hatchback is a coup...Standard equipment is decent and the options list is long. On the entry level car, you'll get a half-leather interior, plus the 8ins touchscreen, Bluetooth, cruise control and climate control. For sat nav as standard, you need to step up to SE Tech trim...Standard equipment on the entry level car is decent and you'll get a half-leather interior, plus the 8ins touchscreen, Bluetooth, cruise control and climate control. An autonomous emergency braking system is also included, as is a lane departure warning system...In order to get satellite navigation thrown in as standard, you'll need to step up to SE Tech trim, which comes with other convenience additions like a power-assisted gesture tailgate...Topping up your car with extras can be done through the various option packs Land Rover offers. On a standard Discovery Sport SE, packs like the Connect Pack can be attached for ?415. This will give your car a Wi-Fi hotspot and various InControl apps that allow you to do things like pre-heating the cabin...There are two lighting packs ? for ?1,245 you get adaptive Xenon headlamps with automatic high beam assist; for ?985 you get non adaptive Xenons. A range of styling packs is also available, as well as rugged options like detachable and electric tow bars...Higher spec cars can be fitted with higher spec toys. The entertainment pack gives an improved sound system, a television screen and InControl touch pro navigation functions, allowing you to pinch and zoom around the touchscreen like a smartphone. However, you'll have to start with a high spec car to unlock the pack which is priced at ?1,900. Screens can be fitted to the back of the front seats alongside this pack for ?4,140...Driving technology packs are also available. The all-round vision assist pack introduces a surround camera system, as well as a blind spot monitor, traffic sign recognition and a head-up display for ?2,385. More or less the same options are presented in the driver assist tech pack, which drops the head up display for park assist features. The pack, which starts at ?1,970, makes it much easier to parallel park by identifying spaces and being able to both pull up and exit the spot automatically...In terms of engines, there are only two choices, both of them 2.0-litre diesel four-cylinders, one with 150bhp and the other with more power at 180bhp. They replace the 2.2-litre SD4 diesel the car launched with and are far lighter, quieter and more efficient... says the newer engines bring about a new level of refinement ? at cruising speed, "the engine note subsides to a faint background hum", feeding back into the car's quiet, comfortable nature...A six-speed manual gearbox comes as standard, but the magazine recommends you equip the optional nine-speed automatic transmission if you can afford the ?1,800 premium...Faster engine options are likely to emerge, reports .., with a range-topping Special Vehicle Operations (SVR) version on the cards...The magazine has published spy shots of a Discovery Sport undergoing testing, with a masked-off but sportier-looking front end, and speculates it could be powered by a petrol version of the 2.0-litre Ingenium power unit, with around 298bhp. The mag notes that Land Rover has officially said there are no plans in place for a petrol version to go on sale in the UK, but should an SVR happen, it could arrive at some point in 2017...The new 2.0-litre Ingenium engines are more efficient than the 2.2-litre SD4 power unit the car launched with...The less powerful 148bhp version of the 2.0-litre delivers a claimed 57.7mpg and 129g/km CO2 emissions, meaning a road tax bill of ?110 a year. The six-speed manual gearbox is the only option available...Bumping things up to the 178bhp version doesn?t harshly impact efficiency, although there is a slight dent. Official MPG figures are rated at 52.2 and it emits slightly more CO2 at 139g/km. This pushes the car into VED band E, meaning you'll pay ?20 more a year in tax...When the going gets tough, the Discovery Sport is "predictably excellent", .. says. Ground clearance isn't as great as on Land Rover's bigger cars, but the narrow profile "affords breathing room down tight tracks" and it's capable of everything the owners will demand ? and more...As standard, drivers get Land Rover's Terrain Response system and Hill Descent Control. Wading depth comes in at 23.5ins and the short overhangs front and rear mean there are excellent approach and departure angles... verdict is positive. The Freelander's upmarket replacement is a "good value, remarkable, capable, and practical family SUV", it says. The car ticks three major boxes: an eye-catching design, brilliant driving characteristics and ? importantly for Land Rover enthusiasts ? off-road prowess.?..The site's favourite model is the 178bhp engine in HSE trim. It's one of the more expensive cars but features creature comforts such as satellite navigation, keyless entry, automatic lights and wiper. Parking sensors are also thrown in. Luxurious additions like 19ins alloy wheels, a panoramic sunroof and a full leather interior are included.?..Of note is just how calming Land Rover's entry level SUV is to drive. The cabin is very quiet, even at speed, and is mated to a composed suspension setup.?..It's "one very complete family car", says the magazine, which recommends the 178bhp engine in SE Tech trim.?..Prices begin from ?31,095 for the 150bhp engine option with a six-speed manual gearbox and in entry level SE trim. The more powerful engine kicks off at ?32,795 and the cheapest automatic gearbox begins at ?34,600...There is also a wide choice of trims. On top of SE, there's SE Tech, which piles sat nav on top of the standard equipment and starts from ?32,845.?It's the trim .. recommends, saying the ?1,800 jump from entry-level spec is "well worth it" for the addition of key extras such as navigation, automatic wipers and lights, front-facing parking sensors and powered tailgate...Added to that there are three derivatives of HSE trim, which start with the basic at ?35,785, for which drivers get leather seats, Xenon lights, keyless entry, 19ins alloy wheels, a reversing camera and an 11-way stereo speaker system. Next up, HSE Luxury, from ?41,595, adds ten-way adjustable memory electric seats, plus heated and cooled seats back and front while semi-autonomous parking will automatically steer the car into tight spots, both parallel and bay...The most expensive car is the HSE Dynamic Lux, which adds new styling features in the form of the Black Pack and costs ?46,510...Key premium rivals for the Discovery Sport include the Audi Q5, BMW X3, and Mercedes-Benz GLC...The Land Rover is a new car, so that makes it a tempting proposition compared to the Audi, which is starting to get on a bit. The Q5 is due for replacement later this year - or early 2017 - but the current version is already more expensive than the Disco Sport, with a starting price of ?32,580. Added to that, it's only a five-seater...Prices also came to the fore when .. pitted the Discovery Sport against both the X3 and the GLC, saying that BMW's offering starts from ?33,945, while the Mercedes product also comes at a premium, kicking off at ?35,580...And again, while they're very spacious five-seaters, neither car can match the Land Rover in terms of how many people-carrying power both are five seaters, it adds...In addition, TG feels the BMW simply isn't good enough to justify being an SUV.

The Complete Car Price Guide: 9 Ways to Save | Trusted Choice
https://www.trustedchoice.com/insurance-articles/wheels-wings-motors/car-price-guide/

Make sure you?re getting the best car price out there. This guide can help you learn how to shop like a pro and get the car that fits your budget.

When it comes to new cars, the number you are bound to run up against most often in advertisements, brochures and on the sales floor is the sticker price. However, the price of a car is so much more than the big black number on the window. This common-sense, comprehensive car price guide can help you avoid marketing traps and pitfalls so you get the best vehicle for your driving needs...This is the price the dealer wants you to pay. It is the MSRP, or Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price. The price the dealer charges you may, in fact, be higher or lower than the MSRP price, depending on demand and your negotiation skills. Despite the impression a salesperson may give you, the sticker price is almost always negotiable...The term .. refers to the price a dealer pays to purchase the car at wholesale cost from the manufacturer. Because car dealerships are retail businesses, which must make a profit, you will probably not be able to purchase a brand new, in-demand car for the invoice price. It isn't impossible, however...Philip Reed of Edmunds.com writes, "A dealer could sell a car at invoice price, tell the customer that's he not making one penny on the deal and still get a check from the manufacturer a month later for $500." This is because of manufacturer incentives called "holdback" rebates that the manufacturer pays to the dealer after a car sells. In most cases, your final cost will fall somewhere between the invoice price and sticker price...If a car is hot off the assembly line and there is high demand for it in your area, the market price could run higher than the sticker price. But once things have died down a bit, market price usually runs somewhere between the invoice price and sticker price...What you pay for your car and what your neighbor would pay for the same car could be very different. Car buying advisor Al Hearn notes, "Selling prices can vary considerably for a particular vehicle make and model, depending on the dealer, area of the country, city size, competition, time of month, time of year, negotiating skills of the buyer, and available incentives." So what can you do to make sure you are getting the best car price possible?..Reed advises that this can be a strong starting strategy. Dealers have become more open to showing the invoice in recent years. If you politely ask to see it, you can take a look at the dealer's buying price and use it as a car price guide. Offer a reasonable profit, say $800 over invoice. This gives you a strong starting point in the negotiations, instead of trying to work backward from the sticker price...There are a lot of little extras on the final bill you sign to pay for your new car. They can add up to a tidy sum for the dealer. These are usually semi-legitimate expenses on the dealer's part, such as transport and delivery, dealer add-ons and financing. Some buyers work to negotiate these fees into the agreed price of the vehicle to avoid any extra fluff in the final tally...The used car trade is often more profitable for dealers than their new car business. When you agree to a trade in your car, you are usually letting it go for much less than you could have made on the open market. Why not sell it yourself and have that much more to put down on your new vehicle?..When you buy used, you have the advantage of foregoing the big black sticker price altogether. Pricing becomes much more specific to the age, wear, mileage and location of the specific car you would like to purchase. It is up to you to find the best deal around, whether it be on a used car lot, in an online marketplace ad or in your neighbor's driveway...For used car pricing guidelines, you will need sources like Kelley Blue Book, NADA Guides and your local Car Trader leaflets. These car pricing guides can give you average amounts for the make and model you need, at different levels of wear. However, the actual used car prices will depend on each car's specific troubles and strengths, as well as the willingness of the owner to negotiate. Don't be afraid to ask for a lower price if you feel the need to. And if the owner rejects your offer, don't be shy about checking back in a week or so to see if the seller has reconsidered...If you plan to take out a loan for your new car, try to secure financing before you ever go to the sales lot. The financing room is where the dealership makes some of its biggest profits, and it does not help you one bit. Your local credit union or bank can usually offer you much more reliable advice and interest rates. Jason Fogelson writes for .., "Know how much you qualify for, and what interest rate you can get on your own. Better yet, arrive at the dealership with a loan pre-approval in hand. Then, you will be in a position to assess the offer that the F&I guy slides across the desk."..It doesn't do you much good to get a great price on your car and then overpay for insurance year after year. It always pays to shop around and make sure you're getting the best price out there for your ... A local independent agent can serve as a car pricing guide for policies from a huge variety of insurance companies so that you can be sure you're getting the best premium and coverage possible. Trusted Choice.. agents are independent and ready to help you when you're buying that new car...Once you have this car price guide safely committed to memory, you can hit the car lots and seller ads with confidence that you're getting the best deal on your new car.........?..

New car incentives, a record number of off-lease vehicles, and an overall increased supply of used vehicles will combine to lower used car prices after strong year-over-year price increases, according to ...?Check it out to find out how these factors will affect your used vehicle sales and profitability...LAS VEGAS ? A record 3.1 million off-lease vehicles will flood the used-car market this year. Lots of them are cars that aren?t in demand in the CUV-crazy U.S. And automakers have been jacking up new-car incentives...Those factors combine to make 2016 a down year for wholesale used-car prices, following a five-year streak marked by strong prices, hot demand and relatively lean supplies...?Last year was another phenomenal year for used cars, with prices up 18% over pre-recession years,? says Jonathan Banks, a used-car auto analyst for the National Automobile Dealers Assn...This year will be different though, with an expected 5%-6% drop in pre-owned vehicle prices, Banks predicts at a press conference during the 2016 NADA convention here...Off-lease vehicles descending on the used-car market this year carry an 800,000-unit increase over 2015...?Most of that volume will be dominated by compact and midsize cars,? he says. Those vehicle segments currently are among the softest in the industry...Late-model used-car supply is expected to hit the highest level since 2008, and represent the biggest drag on vehicle prices, Banks says...But new-car incentives will affect matters too. Automakers are expected to lay those on thicker than before to bolster new-vehicle sales that WardsAuto forecasts will reach 17.8 million units this year...?Increasing new-vehicle incentives will put downward pressure on used-car prices,? Banks says. ?Incentives have been creeping up since 2011.? Five years ago, industry incentives were 8.3% of MSRP. Now they are 9.6%, which Banks describes as ?really high.?..Used-car prices could decrease even more than he currently predicts if automakers really step up new-car incentives such as rebates and sweet lease deals. ?Incentives are the wild card,? he says...He adds: ?Leasing is fantastic. You get people returning to dealerships more often because of that 3-year churn. But you don?t want to go back to the 1990s when leasing was a drag on the used-car market.?..Americans bought about 40 million used cars last year. Of those, 2.55 million were purchased through automakers? certified pre-owned operations established at dealerships to remarket off-lease vehicles...But such programs can only help so much. ?CPO is not a savior,? Banks says...Growing wholesale supplies will translate into higher pre-owned vehicle sales, ?but at what retail margins?? Tom Webb, Manheim Consulting?s chief economist, says here...The waves of off-lease vehicles will only get higher in coming years, he says. ?Let?s not kid ourselves.

This is a page for electric vehicle car answers and facts of various sorts. If you've got something to add, drop a note in the comments below! This page will be continually updated.

....Are electric cars your thing? Good, this is a page packed full of electric car facts, including electric cars for sale in 2016 in the US and their prices. Electric car answers for any question you have should be on this page. If not, drop us a note so that we can add them. If you have some important electric car answers to common questions or interesting facts to add, also drop a note in the comments below! This page will be continually updated...The following are electric cars that are?for sale today?in the US or are supposed to be for sale at some point in 2016...The first prices listed are base prices before the federal tax credit, and in parenthesis are prices after the federal tax credit (normally $7,500, but often less than that if the cars aren?t 100% electric cars).?.. potentially available in your city or state (such as the $2,500 California EV rebate or $5,000 Georgia EV tax credit) are not included...Links on the car names are mostly to our story archives for these cars.?Links on the prices are to the car companies? pages for the cars...Range and MPGe/MPG data come from the EPA...Check these electric cars out and go test drive some this weekend!..The .. is a cute and fun little two-seater that comes in at a super?affordable price. With just two seats, it?s clearly not a ?family car,? but it is a ton of fun to drive and very adequate for most driving needs. Despite (or because of) its small size, the Twizy was the .. and?... It?s really a blast to drive. I?d recommend it. Read my .....The .. (aka Mitsubishi i-MiEV) is one of the most basic electric cars on the market, but also one of the cheapest. As noted below, the?Citr?en C-Zero,?Peugeot iOn, and?Mitsubishi i all have essentially the same design but serve different markets...The .. could be the cheapest electric car on the US market? if you don?t own or lease it for very long. However, due to an $80/month battery rental, the price rises to about the same as a 2014 Mitsubishi i within 3 years (note that the Mitsubishi i seats 4, while the smart electric drive seats two). Within about 6 years, the smart electric drive is about the same price as a 5-seat and much more plush Nissan Leaf. In my personal opinion, the smart electric drive is a hard sell ? unless you really want a tiny car or only want it for 2 to 3 years. Read .. or the .....The .. is a low-priced 100%-electric car that has gotten good reviews (compared to its gasoline cousin, that is) but is only available in a few markets. The Chevy Spark EV was the first car on the market that could use the?SAE Combo Fast Charging system...The ..?is VW?s second electric car, following close behind the VW e-Up! (yes, the exclamation mark is part of the name). Clearly, the e-Golf is?an electric version of VW?s extremely popular Golf model. The e-Golf is one of?the closest competitors to the world-leading Nissan LEAF, so it could potentially see very big sales numbers.?However, Volkswagen doesn?t sell it widely, so sales are much lower. Read .....The .. is seemingly the most competitive electric car on the market. It is the world?s best-selling electric car? by far. After test driving several EVs myself, I have to say that it would be hard to beat the Nissan Leaf for the?money? unless you have enough?money to dump on a higher-end EV, like the Tesla Model S or BMW i3. Though, I have heard several people say they prefer the Volkswagen e-Golf (which I?m yet to drive). Read ... You can also read .....The ..is?Ford?s only 100%-electric car was?overpriced for a long time and simply unable to compete with competitors like the Nissan Leaf. But?Ford finally knocked the price down by several thousand dollars and it is quite competitive with the LEAF. Unfortunately, Ford has hardly advertised the Focus Electric in its several years on the market, and I don?t think it?s widely available. Needless to say, it still isn?t selling nearly as well as the Leaf...The .. has gotten great reviews. However, the head of Fiat apparently hates electric cars (..) and is only producing the 500e in ..?(basically, because ..). Hopefully the cute electric car will someday soon be available to a broader market. With its relatively low price, good reviews, and cool styling, it could give some of the top-selling electric cars on the market a run for their market...The ..?is a snazzy electric vehicle with a bit more space on the inside than the average car, and a clear youngster appeal.?The Kia Soul EV has sold okay in the markets where it?s available, but it isn?t broadly available, and its overall sales in the US are pretty sad. You can check out .....The .. is one of the most widely acclaimed electric cars on the market. It is the top-selling electric car in the US to date. In 2013, it was the ... Volt owners are known as Voltheads and were ?..? in the US for two years running? before the Tesla Model S arrived (as per Consumer Reports owner satisfaction surveys).?The 2nd-generation Chevy Volt improves in numerous ways on the 1st-generation award-winner. Check out our two reviews of the new Volt .. and .....Quite similar to the?Ford C-Max Energi but with a few more bells & whistles, the .. has done quite well since its introduction in February 2013. The?Ford Fusion Energi certainly offers some competition to the Chevy Volt, the Toyota Prius Plug-in, and its sister, the C-Max Energi. Importantly, for some people, it is larger than all three of these competitors.?It has a bit less electric range than the Volt, but it has enough seats for five passengers. (It has much more electric range than the Prius, and the same as the C-Max Energi ? both of which seat 5.) And it is quite the looker...The other car?in Ford?s Energi (plug-in hybrid electric vehicle) lineup, the .., has quite good specs for someone who doesn?t drive very far on most days but wants to take very long trips fairly regularly. It?s also good for 3-kid families, as it seats up to 5 people. Despite seating 5, it is cheaper than the Chevy Volt? until you factor in the federal tax credit. The C-Max Energi?is also the most efficient plug-in hybrid electric car on the market. As a result of all of this, the car has sold quite well. Despite only being available in the US, the?C-Max Energi was the .....The .. was either?the?... Unfortunately, its electric range is just 11 miles, then the gas engine kicks in. The Prius PHEV was?most likely aided by the strong, high-selling Prius brand. It mainly competes with the Chevy Volt, Ford C-Max Energi, and?Ford Fusion Energi, but it has more seats than the Volt and is almost $10,000 cheaper than the Fusion Energi. So, its closest competitor is probably the?Ford C-Max Energi. This seems to be a good place in the EV spectrum, as both cars have been doing quite well. Of course, the C-Max Energi has 10 more miles of electric range, almost double the Prius PHEV?s 11 miles. Either due to the increasing competition, people simply deciding they want more electric range, or Toyota cutting supply, sales of the Prius Plug-in fell off a lot toward the end of 2014? and they?ve never recovered...The .. is?another plug-in hybrid electric car?with a bit of a sporty offering.?The electric-only range is not spectacular, but is at least better than the Toyota Prius Plug-in! It can go from 0 to 60 mph in a respectable 7.5 seconds. It has also landed a difficult ... The A3 e-tron has a tough time competing with the ..?and Ford Energi models on value for the money, but some clearly?prefer the e-Tron?s looks?and?the Audi brand. As expected, the A3 e-tron is not widely available, which provides it with the ?compliance car? label. You can read .....The Hyundai Sonata Plug-In Hybrid is a fairly large and luxurious plug-in hybrids with moderate electric range. Clearly, it?s a bit higher in price than competing Ford Energi models and the Chevy Volt, but it?s a bit lower in price than the Mercedes B250e and BMW i3. You can see .....The?..?(now called the B250e) is an extremely close competitor to the BMW i3, and is a first-offering from Mercedes in this department.?It has a Tesla drivetrain at its core, and reviewers have been split between it and the BMW i3, with .. and ...?One of our top EV reporters?has?the B-Class Electric and reviewed it .. and .....The .. is BMW?s first 100%-electric car built electric from the ground up. It is part of BMW?s ?born electric? i series. It?s price puts it somewhat in the middle of the Nissan Leaf and the Tesla Model S. Despite looking a bit bulky, the BMW i3 is the lightest electric car on the market, thanks to its carbon fiber body. It?s a smooth & sweet drive. Compared to BMW?s overall sales, the i3 is selling very well, making it clear that ...?Read?.., and/or?.., and/or .....The .. is another fairly expensive offering from BMW. This one, though, is a plug-in hybrid rather than a fully electric car. It has exciting acceleration at 5.9 seconds to 60 mph, and the luxury and handling you?d expect from a typical BMW of this price. We are yet to get behind the wheel of a 330e. Stay tuned for a review once we do...The .. is a high-end, luxury, plug-in hybrid electric car that hit the market at the very end of 2013. In many respects, it is essentially a more luxurious and higher-performance Chevy Volt. It is pretty.

I haven?t gotten in an?X5 iPerformance yet, but I can say with confidence ... However, even after the tax credits, the Model X is nearly $20,000 more, so I guess that depends on one?s price sensitivity to some degree. (Just note that you can save a lot of money on fuel with the Model X.)..The ..?is yet another plug-in hybrid electric SUV that hit the US market in 2016. With a bit more seating space?and?a quicker 0?60 time, the .. also costs a bit more than the BMW X5 iPerformance.

As Elon Musk has said, the choice between the Model X and Model S is really just whether or not you want an SUV/crossover or a sedan.?The Model X is special for combining excellent performance, great utility, and hot styling.

I think ?wicked? is the word for that...The ..?is a plug-in hybrid electric sports car that is everything you?d expect ? awesome. It can go from 0 to 60 miles per hour in ~5 seconds. The?Panamera S E-Hybrid now accounts for nearly 10% of all Panamera sales. It?s a ton of fun to drive, but still a bit hard to justify for the price with other high-performance EVs on the market. The place where it has them beat is in luxury. You can read .. and?.....Oh, what was that ? the above prices weren?t high enough for you? Well, I?m yet to set foot in a .., but I?m guessing it has a bit of luxury and snaz, because the price is way up there. Despite being a luxury sedan, it still has great acceleration, getting to 60 mph in 5.2 seconds. We haven?t yet reviewed this model, so I think Mercedes shuold drop one off at more doorstep sometime...The .. is BMW?s second i-series car.?It?s one of the most?expensive cars on the market ? actually, the most expensive on the mass market today. It comes with a ton of style and great acceleration (0 to 60 mph in 4.4 seconds only trails the Tesla Model S P85D?s 3.2 seconds amongst electric cars). It?s hard not to covet this beauty. While it has amazing power and is a lot of fun to drive, it is again hard to justify such a high price with other high-performance cars like the Model S much cheaper, but if you?re chasing style, this may well be top dog.?You can read .. and?.....The at-the-register?price tag of EVs and PHEVs is higher than that of similarly sized and equipped gasoline-powered cars, mostly because batteries are expensive. How expensive? That?s hard to know, because car manufacturers generally won?t say what they are paying for their batteries, or what they expect to pay in 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, etc.?Here are some of the best answers we?ve got for now regarding EV battery prices for specific models:.., while the rest of the industry was?projected to be no lower than $400/kWh (that seems dubious). But the latest figure from a Tesla representative pegs its battery pack cost at ... (Note that CEO and Chairman?Elon Musk stated?in February 2012 that the .. in the ?not-too-distant future.?).., which probably translates into a battery pack cost around $190/kWh as well...For some historical background, though,?here?s?some info from a?2012 BNEF report that found that the?.., and 30% from?2009 to 2012 (..):..?Electric vehicles such as the Mitsubishi Motor iMiEV, Nissan Leaf or Tesla Model S require between 16 and 85kWh of storage, with a total cost of $11,200 and $34,000, or around 25% of the total cost of the vehicle,? BNEF notes. ?Battery pack prices for plug-in hybrid vehicles such as GM?s Volt are on average 67% higher in terms of $/kWh, than those for electric-only vehicles like Nissan?s Leaf. This higher price is mainly due to the greater power-to-energy performance required for plug-in hybrid vehicles.?..A more recent BNEF study found that ... It stated that prices fell 65% since 2010. But ..?battery pack prices at $350/kWh, which is considerably higher than the Tesla/Panasonic & GM/LG Chem estimates...For another broad view,?here?s a .., on battery costs (emphasis mine):..?Overall, the Department of Energy is partnering with industry to reduce the manufacturing cost of advanced batteries.

If so, differentiation comes down to the speed and ubiquitousness of the fast charging network, and brand ?coolness?. I?ve already picked my winner in both camps, but I?d like to hear what the experts think...It will also be fascinating to see who is first to market ? they will surely score the most and best free press, as the world slowly realises that petroleum (as fuel) has had its day. The race is on...Seems to me that GM and Tesla are likelies...I wouldn?t be surprised to see Nissan increase their range but stay well below 200 miles in order to set a selling price well under $30k (unsubsidized)...I don?t know about BMW.

If Nissan has a 200 mile range battery then Renault will as well...Dear Bob,..I drive about 3 17 mile trips each day.  @ 34 miles round trip this is about 100 miles each day about 30k miles/year...I have been looking at used Nissan LEAF?s with chademo DCQC LEVEL 3 charging ports.  The problem I am running into is that chargers for this standard seem to be unobtanium. That is not for sale!  Nissan now claims that dcqc is only for commercial use.  yet they will not refuse to sell the car with it.  only the charger. I would love to be able to charge as fast as my 50kW 244V 200A single phase circuit breaker box will put out. but even close would meet my needs...CAN you please help me find one that will work and give between 30kW and 50kW.  ..I refuse to buy the car until i can get the charger lined up!!!!..Sorry, Glen.  That?s outside my box of knowledge.  Let?s see if one of the people who are up on chargers can help out...Also, have you tried any of the EV forums?  I would imagine there?s one or more Leaf discussion forums...But, let me see if I understand.  You drive about 34 miles three times a day on most days?  How much time do you have between trips?..Which year Leafs are you considering?  I seem to recall that Nissan increased the size of their built in charger at one point.  Here?s what Wiki says ?..?Models with an on-board 6.6 kW charger can be fully recharged from empty in 4 hours from a 220/240-volt 40 amp supply (7.7 kW allowable draw) that can provide the on-board charger its full 6.6 kW of usable power.?..If you would expect a 70 mile range (highway driving) that means you?d be picking up `17.5 miles per hour of charging.  (70 / 4 = 17.5).  If you drove 34 miles and then plugged in for 2 hours it seems like you?d be fully charged and ready to go on the next 34 mile jaunt...There are very big tech advancements on the way, due 2017 but maybe sooner. Electric range almost doubled, for example, across the board. Also I think it is not yet settled how best to recharge. Tesla continues with the fillup station paradigm, but also possible and in my view very preferable is battery swapping. Swapping is not yet a good choice because batteries are heavy and many people don?t like to grunt. But ideas are being explored involving use of several batteries of lesser size rather than one big battery, resulting in less grunting. This ability to conveniently and effectively combine batteries is relatively new tech which the industry is probably still not leveraging to its full potential...Tesla has offered battery swapping and found almost no interest...You say ?battery swapping? as if it was just one clear and settled thing. Not so. I?m not referring to the Better World idea. I just recently read about some university that has a battery that can be swapped for a refill like a propane tank. I think that?s the way to go. Tesla didn?t offer anything like that. But rather than one big propane tank, I was thinking maybe 10 small batteries of maybe DVD size each, where the driver can keep maybe 5 or so filled batteries in his car (glove compartment?). And installation should be via dashboard convenience: if one of the 10 small batteries gets low, just pop it out, grab a replacement from the glove compartment, and plug it in. Should be able to do this while driving, with the other 9 batteries providing enough electric power while one is being changed out. The tech for this isn?t quite here yet, but it is very close and it clearly will be here soon. I recommend a smart company like Tesla plan for exactly this. And enough with treating electricity like gasoline. We don?t need electric fillup stations just because that?s the way we?ve always done it...?some university that has a battery that can be swapped for a refill like a propane tank. I think that?s the way to go.?..Try digging out some cost numbers.  ..? I was thinking maybe 10 small batteries of maybe DVD size each, where the driver can keep maybe 5 or so filled batteries in his car (glove compartment?).?..That would take enormous capacity (Wh/L).  Gasoline is very much more energy dense than batteries.  How far to you think you could drive with a DVD (case) sized container of gas?..?The tech for this isn?t quite here yet, but it is very close?..That is highly doubtful...Why don?t you go back and reread.  What you?re reporting here sounds like it?s from a sci fi site...Electric tech is advancing very rapidly so in order to hit the target one has to ?lead? the target. If we had not looked forward originally, we would not now have any electric cars at all...I say, ?The tech for this ? is very close.? ?Highly doubtful,? you reply. You are entitled to your opinion but I am entitled to disagree. And I do...David, do you have any facts to back up your opinion?..@Bob: I do have facts to back up my opinion, but of course I don?t have facts to prove my opinion. Otherwise we wouldn?t be calling it opinion. I?ll give just one fact, this the biggest, I believe: in the last 10 years, EVs have advanced from glorified golf carts to one of the three best cars commercially available. I?m speaking of Tesla?s gem, of course. But even cars like the LEAF or Volt represent big advances in technology, and most tech prognosticators believe this is just the beginning. ..I?m hearing from pretty much all sources that by 2017 a 200 mile EV range will be typical, with the range soon to be much greater than that. This is what I?m hearing as the expert opinion. Experts can certainly be wrong but that?s the way to bet. In any case, while this hardly constitutes fact enough to prove my assertions, it clearly describes a very rapidly advancing technology. ..Today, there is no DVD-size battery that can provide even, say, 20 miles of range. But in 10 years, yes, I believe that is very likely. Maybe in considerably less time than that. And then 10 of those 20-mile DVD-sized batteries, working in tandem, will power an EV, eliminate range anxiety, and allow a guy like me, who parks on the street, to own an EV. A smart guy like Musk should be heading in this direction. My opinion...?Today, there is no DVD-size battery that can provide even, say, 20 miles of range. But in 10 years, yes, I believe that is very likely?..David, I don?t think you realize how dense a storage system we would need to move an EV 20 miles on a DVD sized storage device...Gasoline contains 9,700 Wh/l.  ..A DVD has a surface area of 109.4 cm sq.  The thickness is 0.12 cm thick.  That would make the volume 13.1 cm squared.  Or 0.0131 liters...A DVD of gasoline would contain 127 Wh of energy.  0.127 kWh.  Enough energy to drive an EV about 0.4 miles.  Five ?DVD?s would be adequate for about 2 miles...Twenty miles on a ?DVD? assumes someone is going to invent a storage medium fifty times as dense as gasoline...The current capacity of lithium-ion batteries is around 240 Wh/l.  About 2.5% as dense as gasoline.  Only 0.25% of what you imagine...David, look at where batteries and gasoline are on this energy density chart.  What you envision is some sort of energy rich medium that would lie in the great white unoccupied space of the upper right of the chart...?Twenty miles on a ?DVD? assumes someone is going to invent a storage medium fifty times as dense as gasoline.? What you are actually saying is that you believe nobody ever will invent a storage medium fifty times as dense as gasoline. Certainly not in any foreseeable future...You realize that this is the same argument against, that someone much like yourself would have been making when PCs first came out, if I suggested that RAM capacity would reach gigabyte range. You would be saying, ?David, I don?t think you realize how densely packed a chip would have to be in order for? and yet a chip can (now) only be packed with this much density, which is way less than needed??. Etc. And you would have been wrong. (And btw, I was never smart/knowledgeable enough to make any such computer chip prognostication. That was just a hypothetical.)..I make no guarantees. I don?t know how such advancement will occur, whether it be via new medium or new process or some combination. I?m only saying that electric tech advancement is trending upward very much like the tech advancement curve in computer chip technology, way back when. When I look into my crystal ball I see much greater range from much smaller batteries and again I say, this belief seems to be shared by the tech experts...Enjoy your fantasies, David...Have a nice day...Yeah, Bjorn is wonderful. Very happy he won the referral contest. ??..And on the other stuff as well. See:..I agree..Why combustion engine car makers are on a collision course with destiny:.. ? They don?t want to sell you an electric car, because they will make less profit from parts, servicing and sales of their combustion models... ? If they sell you an electric car, they have to concede that combustion engine cars are pollution emitters... ? They know there?s a tipping point in the market, beyond which sales of combustion cars will drop quickly. Their goal is to reach that tipping point as slowly as possible... ? They know that lithium batteries are only expensive because they are not produced in nearly the same volume as gearboxes, fuel injectors, crankshafts and spark plugs. By delaying market growth they can maintain the fossil fuel economic advantage a little longer... ? They know that lithium batteries are limited in energy density because they have not undergone decades of refinement, as have gearboxes, fuel injectors, crankshafts and spark plugs. By delaying market growth they can maintain the distance-between-refuelling advantage a little longer... ? They know that once you?ve experienced the joy of driving (in) a silent, vibration-free, rocket-fast, odourless car that never needs petrol, wild horses won?t drag you back to fossil fuels...The above reasons explain the following:..The Nissan Leaf has no ?frunk?. Pull the hood and you see a host of stuff that looks like it needs servicing...The boot of a Leaf is the oddest shape ? it?s not remotely flat. There?s a wall between the hole where the fuel tank would normally be and the rear folding seats. Inside that wall is where they unthinkingly stuffed most of the batteries...The Leaf has a 150km range on a full charge. Just low enough to discourage most buyers...The servicing schedule on the Leaf is the same as a combustion car. At service 1 (10,000km), they do nothing other than inspect...I have not seen a single ad on TV (in Sydney) for the Leaf, yet many other Nissan model ads go to air...But here?s the number one reason they?re dreading the EV revolution. It?s all about brand. Let?s assume that Nissan were to release a ?Leaf III?, at the same time as Tesla releases the Model 3 and, let?s also assume that the cars have equivalent range, performance, style and features. Which car will people buy?..People concerned about Earth?s rising CO2 levels, or city pollution, or oil money destined for the Middle East, who buy the Tesla Model 3 will know they?re supporting a company who are part of the solution, not part of the problem. They know that friends who see the brand on their new car know it?s electric without having to ask. The Tesla will have instantly recognisable status. The traditional motoring brands have no way to put distance between logo and exhaust pipe. Imagine yourself on the road in your Nissan Leaf III and the car ahead is a hulking combustion engined Nissan, billowing fumes. How do you feel now, supporting the company that produced that monstrosity?..If I were in charge of strategy for one of the incumbent manufacturers, I?d be immediately looking for a way to take what has value from my brand, yet divorce it completely from what will soon have the stigma of smoking cigarettes in a kindergarten. Don?t believe me? Just watch. When you see ads for ?Nissan Electric?, an all new company (with a stylish new logo) sponsored by, yet autonomous to, the old ?Nissan?, it signals that the new era in motoring has arrived...That?s a very good summary and I suspect your insight it about right...What?s going to be interesting is to see how many current large car manufacturers survive the move to EVs.  Right now we have Tesla along with BYD and other Chinese manufacturers taking EVs seriously.  ..Imagine a future in which Apple and perhaps a couple other ?new car? manufacturers get into the game with mid-priced to luxury EVs and China starts flooding the market with mid-priced and economy EVs...I expect the largest (Toyota, Ford, Honda, GM, etc.) will transition.  But some of the smaller manufacturers may be left behind...Excellent summary. Mind if I publish it as a guest/reader post? Worth a lot of eyeballs. ??..Please do Zachary ? the more eyeballs the better...Carl Sparre..M: 0427 200 275..Ok folks, the verdict is in: Those dumbshit in the Red States (those who voted for the world-class moron named George W. Bush) are neither qualified to drive an electric car nor are they smart enough to desire one. So, by virtue of natural selection, the dumb species should die. And die they will, after sniffing in those toxic fumes from coal-burning power plants, diesel trucks, and those poisonous cigarettes loaded with stuff cockroaches would even reject! ..Something?s really wrong with those conservatives whose brain cells are deeply contaminated with propaganda from the evil oil cartels. They go to church every Sunday but worship the most evil creatures on this planet: the oil companies...So, statistics do not lie (though, they?re often manipulated by corporate America)...Afghanistan has huge deposits of Lithium, guess why we care about Afghanistan...We have huge deposits of lithium in the US and other ?less problematic? countries.  There will be no need for Afghanistan?s lithium for 100 years or more, if ever...New Lithium Sulfur batteries will dramatically increase range, reduce battery weight, and reduce recharging times...May...Is there incentive to buy a Huydai Sonata Hybred? I really like the size and gas mileage...I have been shopping for an electric car in the Pittsburgh area but so far have encountered a rather apathetic and unresponsive sales force.  I have not tried Nissan, because I was interested in something smaller.   I suspect that what few electric cars that are in my metropolitan area (probably no more than a couple dozen) were purchased elsewhere.  Anybody else experiencing this?..Yes, it?s very common with dealers. Dealers make a lot of money on servicing, which EVs need much less of. Furthermore, the guys working there probably don?t ?get? EVs. They often like oil and grit and noise...Question Electric cars are GREEN at point of use agreed ? But only electric produced by solar wind wave is greenish , but fossil   nuclear  is not Green agreed , as most of Europe  is not on green power how can a electric car be green ?..The car is green...The grid needs to get greener...Any plan for Electric cars in India???..Yes, Tata is developing both EVs and PHEVs.  Tesla is going to be selling in India in the near future...Thk...ever notice that when it comes to GM the chevy is the basic car, then they tack on a few frills double the price and then spell chevy a little differently so it then becomes  cadillac...yeah ??..Chevillac. Caddolet...Chevrolet brothers. Three Swiss brothers racing Fords founding a racing company called Frontenac after a Canadian hero...So American. Apple pie and Chevrolet...I am Swiss...Meanwhile Cadillac,..?Cadillac is among the oldest automobile brands in the world, second in America only to fellow GM marque Buick. The firm was founded from the remnants of the Henry Ford Company in 1902, almost nine years before Chevrolet.[4] It was named after Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac, who founded Detroit, Michigan. The Cadillac crest is based on his coat of arms.?..How do you pronounce Detroit? ..History of Detroit, Michigan. Detroit was founded in 1701 when Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac established a fort and settlement on the site. The name means ?strait? in French, and is derived from the narrow river connecting Lake St. Clair with Lake Erie in Michigan. Control of the area passed to the British in 1760...Du twah. Doo twah...You tell me...So Chevrolet raced modified Fords, Cadillac is Ford, And Detroit is a French city...Apple pie. Isn?t that a French thing? No, that?s English...Outstanding post on electric cars.Generally, electric cars are more expensive than regular gas cars. Electric cars run on electricity only. Electric cars have several advantages over regular gas cars such as energy efficient, performance benefits, environment friendly and reduce energy dependence. Save money and fuel by using electric cars. Thanks for sharing such informative post...I have a Bombardier with dead lead acid batteries and would like to convert it to a more modern system. Is there anywhere in Central Florida area where someone could make the conversion and get it working again...All electric cars have serious downsides to the way we use vehicles.  Therefore, they should be cheaper than cheap and they are not.  That is so much like this world, upside down and nobody even mentions it at all.  Insanity runs very strong in this world...Total cost of ownership on an electric car is less that internal combustion engine. It?s close now but the gap is widening...Emerging technology is almost always expensive.  As manufacturing volume grows prices drop...When my family bought their first color TV (19?, mono sound, no remote) it cost about $3,000 in today?s dollars.  The Apple II, and amazingly crude machine by today?s standards, was $2k...And the Lisa, predecessor to the Macintosh, was $10,000 then...My father bought a 20 Megabyte hard drive (yes, megabyte) for $5000 back in the 1980s.  In 1980s dollars (adjusting for inflation would give you an even larger number)...That was probably Apple?s.  I bought my first HD and plugged it into an Apple II after a second vendor came to the game, about ?84.  30 megs for $3,600... $266,667 per gig ramped to today?s dollars.  Of course one can get HD storage for less than 5 cents a gig today...It held about a quarter of our database.  We rotated data on/off using VHS tapes...EVs are more convenient than gasmobiles and offer a better drive quality, among other benefits. See:..It would be great if someone would put the relevant data in spreadsheet form for easy comparison...Will do...Recharge able batteries that provided a viable means for storing electricity on board a vehicle great step. Vehicle that uses electric motors for propulsion, while ?electric car? generally refers to highway-capable automobiles powered by electricity...Leases suck. When driving an EV and not spending money on gas you going to want to drive more and more and wave at the gas stations. Big cities cause a lot of miles to come quick on any lease. I have a Volt for 2 1/2 years and am past total lease miles and work mileage was only 34 miles. You really do not want to lease...I  leased 1 vehicle will never do that again. Had to let the van sit because of too much mileage. Bigger cities make for a lot of miles. As for EVs the batteries should be able to be upgraded. When EVs get older there will most likely be after market parts just like ICE vehicles...So I have a 2015 Chevy volt and I was curious as to the battery limits (it has 2 batteries), and as to anyone?s opinion on installing a (removeable) small subwoofer in the back. I feel a small enough amp/watt system would be safe, and effective. Any ideas???..If you haven?t already found it, the GM Volt forum is a good place for you: ..I noticed under Tesla?s Model X, you listed it has 5 seats, but it actually (according to the video) has seating for 7. Just though it was worth pointing out...Whoops, thanks...Hmm, actually, not sure when it said 5, but I don?t have a # there right now...I got to sit in a Kia Soul last month at the Drive Electric week rally in Sunnyvale. If the e-Golf is listed, the Soul should be too, both will be available soon?..hi..Any data on electromagnetic fields produced by electric motors, batteries, ?, in electric cars?..I?ve seen some that it?s negligible but didn?t dig deeply and didn?t save the links...I think we forgot one car. Mahindra e2o. it is the most affordable ev in the world. 120km range, 19kw powertrain and bevy of other features...Currently running at between US$8,316.60 (Base, Bangalore) and  US$11,901.43 (Premium + Quick2Charge, Delhi).....But this article is about cars for sale in America, and the e2o is only sold in India, Bhutan & Bermuda...How about a worldwide article, Zach?..Thanks Real!..+1 to worldwide article...No problem...I?ve thought about it. Would be a lot of work ?? And specs wouldn?t be comparable from one place to another...What happens if your charge is low, meaning if you are a mile from home is it going to flat out quit or just get slower and slower?..Also are there solar panels available so it can charge while at rest? (The wife drives 50 miles to work and is there for 12 hrs., if you have a 70 mile range, it may charge enough for the trip home)..I know everything is ?relative? but anything like that in the works?..Thanks..Gregg..There?s not that many square feet of surface area on a car roof (hood and trunk).  If super efficient cells weren?t so expensive one might be able to grab a few miles while parked...What really needs to happen is that businesses and schools need to install charge outlets for EV drivers.  That would double the range and make EVs practical for a lot more people...Then put about 3 kW of panels on your roof for every 13,000 miles you drive per year...Thank you, interesting,,  :>)  what about,..What happens if your charge is low, meaning if you are a mile from home..is it going to flat out quit or just get slower and slower, in an EV?..I?m not sure.  I think some EVs have a creep home mode.  They?ll let you take the batteries lower than normally would be allowed but at a much lower speed.  (I?d check that before I believed it.  ;o)..Here?s kind of an interesting read by someone who intentionally ran a Leaf out of charge... ..Pioneering..technologies...The..new real electrical power gain is a quantum leap in the electronics..world with high gain due to increased power for each power source and..is an efficient use of energy for electric vehicles, photovoltaics,..aerospace...INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES ?

Then initially connect the fully charged ultra-capacitor to power the vehicle. In the meantime, the idle power-drained ultra-capacitor shall be connected to the dynamo through the plug-in mechanism for instant  recharging each time the vehicle is being driven...When the ?on service? ultra- capacitor runs low of power, simply switch it out and then switch in the fully re charged ultra-capacitor to the vehicle to continue powering the vehicle. The ?switched out? ultra-capacitor shall then be connected to the dynamo for instant recharging while the vehicle is traveling...Is the foregoing recommendation possible for adoption?..?Is the foregoing recommendation possible for adoption??..No.  What you have there is another variation on the perpetual motion machine.  It?s impossible.  Sorry...The realistic version (which doesn?t violate conservation of energy) is known as regenerative braking, and is present in all electric cars...Yes, I know that, but regenerative braking isn?t expected to completely recharge the battery.  It still needs to be recharged from some other source occasionally to replace energy lost to friction and wind resistance...Pretty remarkable..  post. I simply came across your blog and desired to say that I have really..  enjoyed searching your blog posts.....Options for EVs certainly are becoming more attractive, although the prices are still quite high and range in general is relatively low. That being said there seems to be plenty of competitive and innovation going on in the industry, long may it continue!..Agreed. ?? And a lot of people are looking forward to the Model 3, Chevy Bolt, and 2nd-gen Nissan LEAF. ??..Here in Seattle my wife and I are looking to get a pure electric compact sedan. (Not a a tiny car or a concept car.) Not having the funds for a Tesla, it looks like a Leaf or a Ford Focus Electric. (Electric Fit is still lease-only, right?)..Prob is either Ford Company or Ford dealers here seem not to be serious about selling the Focus Electric. We went to a Ford dealer in Renton and they didn?t have one ?right now? and showed us a used Leaf instead. One in North Seattle sez he only has one in for a day or so; if you don?t show up on day certain, the one he has that 2 weeks or month is gone. This is in complete contrast to when we bought our 2013 Volt; virtually every dealer had at least 1 to show us, and several offered a choice (though I think some were sharing available inventory.) We had several dealers hot to have us test drive, and several offerers at differing prices when we bought. (It?s a wonderful car, btw, but we really dont need both our cars to have gas engines for extended range.)..So is Focus Electric really a) a California-only car, to comply w/ rules to sell a fraction,  b) something Ford hasn?t got its heart in; c) so out-competed by Leaf that nobody wants ?em, or what? What is the skinny on them? Is everybody waiting for the next price down-increment in Tesla models?..I think many of the cars listed are only available and serviced in CA, Toyota RAV4 ev, for one.  It would be useful on the list to indicate where they are sold and serviced. I?ve heard of those who live outside of CA having heck of a time getting service on their RAV4 ev...I think there is a general problem with EVs other than Tesla, which explains why Tesla does not want to use the dealership model. Most dealers are not keen to sell EVs since they will not need as much maintenance and frankly I think many are downright against EVs. I?ve heard of others who went to a Nissan dealer for a Leaf and got steered to a regular car...I think most car companies do not want to build EVs at this time.  I suspect they see no market and want to concentrate on what is currently making them money...They are making a few EVs in order to sell other cars in Ca.  And making a handful gets them ready to jump into the EV market once demand increases. I have to admit that were I running a car company and had to keep profits up it?s likely what I?d do...Nissan, Tesla, GM and to a small extent Toyota are in the electric market. Their market share is very small, splitting it up over several other manufacturers would be bad for electrics.  We need a few manufacturers turning out enough electrics per year to bring battery prices down...Once battery prices come down to where EVs/PHEVs are only a few thousand more than a same-model ICEV then sales will take off...I am looking for a good used EV with gas engine so I can convert the engine to CNG. Any advice on which EV to look for??..what abt pollution??..Pollution hurts my nose...Thank you Zachary, as usual nicely done... The question of electricity sources and ?carbon foot print? of EV verse other types of cars is really a moot issue. The bottom line is, EV technology is more efficient, even when using less than optional energy sources, like coal and gas. A typical ICE engine is 15% efficient gas tank to wheels. EVs are 67-80% battery to wheels. And of course as we clean up our energy sources it becomes even more moot. Same with ?carbon foot print?. Case in point is Germany, where the BMW 3i is made in an economy which during the day energy is 1/3 solar and some wind. Batteries do raise the carbon foot print, but then there is recycling, so not a big sweat. As we move to a renewable energy economy EVs make more and more sense. The Chinese company Kandi is building towers which hold EVs for daily rental. The test city ?Hangzhou? will have perhaps 30 such towers...Here is a pretty cool video about it.....Pingback: ..()..Iposted a video of Tom Hanks driving his electric car on my blog ..Thanks for this article. This article is uncommon but attractive. Here I have found details about electric cars and this is good. General people can get information here and they car purchase an electric car.

Would it be possible to include the battery size with the vehicles and cumulative sales?..Missing Upcoming:..-Cadillac ELR..-Mercedez-Benz SLS AMG Electric Drive..Yes, I update it, but it is ripe for another.

It will be like jumping from a Model T to a Ferrari. Super Conductor technology will revolutionize power storage. Imagine cell phones and Laptops that can run a month on one charge and take less than 30 seconds to recharge. Imagine electric cars with 500 miles or more range and take less than ten minutes to fully charge. Now your talking. That technology is right around the corner. Watch for it!..Super.....There is also OKA NEV ZEV available..From $7,500..Thanks. I don?t include NEVs here...How can it be possible that designers continue to design overlarge, heavy vehicles?

Unfortunately, the Sierra Club is against real time pricing and is encouraging people to adopt flat rate programs that subsidize businesses.  Only with real time pricing can you get electricity at 2 to 3 cents per kilowatt hour.  The Sierra Club plan rates are 5.5 cents per kilowatt hour.   Check  your suppliers.  In general those green energy plans do not encourage conservation or electric vehicles.  Smart meters are the future and give us the best opportunity to have a green energy system...Sierra Club is against real time pricing? That seems odd.

We have covered the car, though. Could you pass along a webpage that includes MPGe or something similar?..This article omits the environmental impact of manufacturing an electric or hybrid vehicle.  Then there?s the impact of predominantly coal generated electricity to charge the batteries of electric cars in the US.  Perhaps the Europeans have something with their 80+ mpg clean diesel cars that can run on vegetable oil...Well, Richard, you thinking that the environmental impact of manufacturing an EV or hybrid is significantly different than the environmental impact of manufacturing a gasmobile?..And since only 36% of American electricity comes from coal but 100% of gas and diesel comes from oil which do you think the larger problem for the environment?  Especially as that 36% is going to continue to drop as the input from wind, solar and geothermal continue to increase...(We?ve haven?t used coal as our predominate electricity source in the US since 2003 when it provided 50.8%.)..And exactly who do you think should give up eating so that the rest of you guys can drive around on vegetable oil?..Yes manufacturing is significantly different.  Subtract all the common elements like sheet metal, upholstery, glass and engine components etc and then add the impact of producing the lithium ion batteries (or whatever batteries).  So I don?t buy the manufacturing side at all.  ..Electricity from coal as of 2005 was 49.6% (Ref. ..). Of the electricity generated in the United States in 2006, 70% was produced from fossil fuels (mainly coal and natural gas), almost 20% came from nuclear power, 7% from hydropower and 3% from other forms of renewable energy such as wind and solar energy. (Ref. ..).  ..In regards to vegetable oil and giving up eating, I wasn?t thinking of Burger King or McDonald?s.  I was thinking about producing low sulfur oil from algae.  A simple Google search will provide tons of info on oil from algae.   (By the way around 90% of the corn produced in the US is not used for human consumption.  It?s wasted on ethanol and animal feed. Ref. ...  And ..)..Lastly, diesel is much more efficient in internal combustion engines because it has a much higher calorific value than gasoline.  We?re talking 80mpg which is unheard of in a country where so much energy is wasted using inefficient 5 and 6 liter V8 gasoline engines (boasting 20mpg). For example, in the UK over 80% of all cars sold including luxury brands like Jaguar, Range Rover, Audi, BMW and Mercedes are all diesel.  Yes, the Toyota Prius is available in the UK but as was proven in a road test a number of years ago, a BMW 520d (diesel) was more economical, (Ref. ..)  I?d go for the larger more economical 5 series BMW any day over the smaller less economical and slower Prius.  ..It appears the Europeans know a lot more about efficient economical eco-friendly vehicles than we do...So you think that mining and processing all the metal it takes for a internal combustion engine along with its cooling, fuel and exhaust systems is less energy demanding than making lithium batteries?  ..Interesting...2005 was a bunch of years ago.  In 2012 US use of coal dropped to 36%.  It will be lower in 2013.  And lower still in 2014...We have approximately 100 coal plants scheduled to close over the next few years.  We?ve essentially quit building coal plants.  Coal is a dead man walking (to borrow a description from a German investment bank)...Nuclear is now down to 19% and will be dropping.  A plant in Wisconsin is closing this year and Oyster Creek is closing in a few years.  Crystal River and San Ononfre are down and may not be coming back up due to extensive repair costs...First half of 2012 we got 7.6% of our electricity from hydro and 5.4% from non-hydro renewables.  Wind, alone, provided 3.5%.  Look for that to go up next year as we just installed a bunch of new wind capacity...Yes, we could power our cars with bio-oil from algae.  If someone figures out how to make it in ample quantities at a reasonable price.  At this point in time algae oil is simply an unproven idea...As for getting our fuel from food crops, even giving up meat?..?If you were to take every gram of crops produced anywhere in the world for all purposes ? and that includes every grape, every ton of wheat, every ton of soybeans and corn ? and you were to use that for biofuels and essentially stop eating, those crops would produce about 14 percent of world energy,? says Timothy Searchinger, an associate research scholar at Princeton University...G. Philip Robertson and colleagues at Michigan State University?s Kellogg Biological Station have been looking at plants that don?t require farm fields...?First, we discovered that the grasses and flowers that take over fields once you stop farming produce a fair amount of biomass, especially if you provide them a little bit of fertilizer,? Robertson says...Robertson and his colleagues surveyed the Midwest acre by acre and identified 27 million acres of marginal farmland where these plants could grow, and where the acreage falls into a compact enough area that someone might want to build a refinery to produce biofuels...They figured that it would become too expensive to transport this heavy and bulky plant material more than 50 miles, from field to refinery...?At the end of the day, we discovered we could produce enough biomass to supply 30 or so of these potential biorefineries,? Robertson says...The 27 million acres identified in the latest study would provide less than 0.5 percent of (US) national energy demand, ..Around 200 million tonnes of waste is produced in UK every year which is capable of producing 4% of the total UK?s electricity and water needs...41% of all US energy is electricity.  28% of all US energy is used for transportation...?..EVs are about 90% efficient.  ICEVs about 20%..Please see my reply to Patrick above.  My whole point is that swapping one form of pollution for another potentially more  environmentally harmful one is not a solution...Were that what was happening everywhere and in the future then you would have a valid point...See my longer reply elsewhere in the thread...But the point you?re missing is very clearly this: it?s not an even swap ? EVs (even on a dirty grid) are much cleaner. If you want to encourage people to bike & use transit, go for it! But as far as automobile options go, there?s no beating an EV today. (Also note that a lot of EV owners are in states with more renewable energy on the grid, and it seems the large majority actually have solar panels on their roof.)..If EVs off the grid are more efficient and cleaner from a total environmental impact standpoint then I stand corrected.  Please keep in mind that electric power station efficiency especially in the case of coal is 30%.  In other words 70% is wasted in the form of heat and other environmentally toxic byproducts. If this is accounted for as part of the ?dirty grid? then I would concede in favor of EV vs clean diesel technology...Yep, UCS has done a thorough study on the matter. I guess a lot of people still haven?t seen that (and you missed it when first reading the article)...Zach,..Can you refer us to that study. I mention it all the time but I cannot cite it..ICEVs waste 80% of their fuel in the form of heat...We?re learning that even ?clean? diesel may be harming our health...Once more, don?t concentrate on the grid as it is now, or especially yesterday.  We are very likely in the early years of a massive move away from fossil fuels.  Just real the posts on this web site for a while.  What you?ll see is stories about how grids around the world are changing and about new developments in clean technology which will drive those changes faster and faster...Go up to the top of the page and click on the ?Wind? and ?Solar? sections that Zach has put together.  Look at how renewables are growing...Those same power stations also produce billions of kWhs of electricity needed to refine gasoline, in cars that are about 22% efficient. Electric motors are 90% or more efficient...Yes it is a solution, Why don?t you check Shanghai China,  The smog caused by auto emissions in  there is staggering, would be minimized if all the cars were electric. At the coal plant is easier to control emissions rather than control emissions in millions of cars. Besides even if 100% of the electricity used by an EV is coal based the emission is smaller than and internal combustion engine. Also notice Coal plants are being closed every year,and that is awesome.  Check this analysis by UCLA....I?m so sick and tired of folks coming in years after the conversation start and saying, hey this is why ?none of what you say matters.? Even if they said, I thought much about about this but this is why you seem to be wrong, would be annoying at this point...I?m a little lost here.  You just commented to a two year old thread and you?re complaining that people do that?..Maybe some carbs will help!..I have tried vehiclecommercial (dot) com  myself, they have some genuine get paid to drive programs. Worth to make a difference..Electric cars are dramatically more energy efficient simply because electric engines are more efficient. Most importantly, batteries create a standardized interface that separates energy generation from it?s use. It?s engineering 101: build an interface so the two systems can evolve independently. ..Agreed if you just look at it from an EV standpoint.  For example, there.. are people driving around in hydrogen powered cars believing they have a.. zero carbon footprint.  If you just look at the car, with water as..exhaust, it is true.  However, when you look at the energy required to..produce and compress the hydrogen, nothing can be further from the..truth.  ..We need to look at the whole picture.  Hybrid cars like..the Prius have batteries and an internal combustion engine.  Should you..look at the carbon footprint in producing one of these cars, I?m sure..you?ll find it?s greater than producing a diesel equivalent vehicle.  My.. point is simply this: ?Swapping one form of pollution for another is..not a solution?.  ..I?m open to finding the best energy efficiency.. combined with the lowest manufacturing and operational carbon..footprint.  In the meantime please hang on to the insults...If you?re looking for the cleanest option right now it is not going to be one size fits all.  ..If, for example you have a commute within the range of an EV such as the LEAF and live in a place with a very green grid, say Idaho, or perhaps work nights and could charge your ride with rooftop solar then an EV is for you...If, however, you live in a utility service area that uses lots of coal then a high MPG gas/diesel might be a better choice...?..But if you?re wondering what the future best choice would be it?s very likely it will be EVs.  ..We, all around to world, are greening our grids.  Wind and solar technologies have just developed to the point at which they make economic sense and they will continue to drop in price.  We?ve got very promising battery technology coming out of the lab, we should see affordable 200 mile range batteries in the near future...We can?t make liquid fuel as cheaply as we can make electricity.  Driving an EV with US average priced electricity is like driving a 50 MPG gasmobile on $1.80/gallon fuel.  ..($0.12/kWh x 0.3 kWh/mile = $0.036/mile.)..(50 miles x $0.036/mile = $1.80/gallon.)..We cannot, even if we had the land and water, make biofuel for $2/gallon...We can?t make and distribute hydrogen as cheaply as we can electricity...Furthermore, the price of electricity will drop.  EVs charging on smart meters will use the cheapest available electricity, not average price...?..Have you ever torn down and reassembled an internal combustion engine?  If you have then you know how many carefully designed and manufactured separate pieces there are.  All made of metal which means lots of ore extracted and processed into various different metals...I?m pretty sure you?ve changed batteries in a flashlight.  Just a bunch of identical containers filled with some chemicals.  Very much simpler, easier to automate, very high volume production of identical components ? that leads to lower cost manufacturing...When economies of scale kick in the purchase price of an EV should fall below that of a gasmobile...Hybrids are a bridge technology. They are supporting and creating a battery market, advancing fuel efficiency technology, etc. Short term evolutionary steps are never perfect...Hydrogen cars are in their infancy and can be made efficient. Just because they aren?t perfect now doesn?t mean they can?t be perfect later...The whole picture is that electric cars are more efficient. Even if we?re simply trading oil for coal, both generating electricity at 30% efficiency, electric cars use that energy more efficiently. They don?t use gas while idling, they can be smaller and lighter by removing the engine and all of the systems that support, etc. ..Most importantly, we?re currently building millions of shitty power generation plants (cars). By separating power generation from usage we can allow new (and regionally variant) power sources to evolve and contribute to vehicles. We can stop being blocked by the infrastructure switching cost problem...MIT Sloan studies show that the vast majority of energy use for passenger cars is from propulsion ? not from production...Richard, if you?re comparing an EV to a normal vehicle, the manufacturing impact isn?t going to be noticeably different...Regarding the source of power used to generate the electricity, there?s a whole section on that above that you seem to have missed. (Some people seem more interested in criticizing a technology than reading about it.)..What?s your real beef with EVs? Do you work in a competing industry? Or just an avid FOX News viewer? (I?m not asking this judgmentally ? just very curious why you?d skip reading an article and then criticize the technology it?s covering.)..Zachary: I have no beef with EVs and do not work for a competing industry.  Furthermore, I agree that EVs are efficient but ultimately the energy comes predominantly from fossil fuel and that was my point.  My only criticism is that we seem to be swapping one form of pollution for another with a potentially greater impact on the environment.  This is not a solution. Yes I did read the article and please see my comments to others in this same discussion thread.  Cars with built in solar panels that do not need electricity from the grid would be a step in the right direction.  Energy derived from methane gas might be another alternative.  The problem is not harnessing the energy, it?s producing it in a sustainable and eco-friendly way.  ..The fact that a BMW-520d diesel beat a Toyota Prius in all round fuel economy makes a very good point for diesel vs hybrid vehicles...If you look at the EPA?s latest ranking of the most efficient vehicles, the top 9 are EVs and the 10th is a PHEV: ..I?m personally not that into cars. I prefer bikes and transit for many reasons. But I?ve become a huge EV supporter because they are much cleaner ? and a lot of people are going to own/drive cars for a long time to come. I had questions about their ?superiority? and I?ve had those resolved...? we seem to be swapping one form of pollution for another with a potentially greater impact on the environment?..Again, that would be true if we were likely to continue using large amounts of fossil fuel to make electricity.  But we won?t...We will continue to make more and more of our electricity using renewable technology.  Let?s look at what happened to date:..2003  2.0% electricity from non-hydro renewables...2006  2.4%..2009  3.7%..2012  5.4% (first half of year)..That is an accelerating curve and I believe that is is only the very early shallow end of a curve that is about to drastically shoot up.  We just installed a lot of wind generation in 2012 and we should see a very large boost in solar in 2013 due to recent price drops...BTW, those numbers do not include end-user rooftop solar, only utility-side solar...?..?Cars with built in solar panels that do not need electricity from the grid would be a step in the right direction.?..Current (affordable) solar panels would not generate enough power to drive very far.  And drivers would have to be careful about where they park, avoid shade/garages/etc...Better to connect panels to the grid and charge off the grid.  Especially with late night wind power...?..?Energy derived from methane gas might be another alternative.?..Methane (natural gas) is not environmentally friendly.  It?s better than coal as it produces less CO2 per unit electricity, avoids the mercury/etc. problems from coal, and is dispatchable.  ..Methane is something that we unfortunately need to use right now to fill in around wind and solar while we develop better storage technology...?..If you wanted to be environmentally friendly what you could do is to buy an EV or PHEV and put some panels on your roof.  Produce as much electricity as you take off the grid to charge your batteries.  Less fossil fuels will be burned while your batteries are charging...If you could do your driving with a LEAF you would be causing zero fossil fuels to be burned...If you needed extra range frequently enough to make a LEAF unusable you could do your first ~40 miles each day  with electricity (make your own) and the rest at about 50 MPG...What I dont understand. These cars have room for 4 or 5 people..most anyways. But?WHY is everyone comparing them to 27-32 mpg cars?..My 2007 and the new 2014 Corolla get 41-43 mpg and only cost 15,000. To pay 30-50,000 up front that will buy alot of gas for a car that gets 40mpg. Furthermore Federal Standards are increasing MPG to 50 mpg by 2025. and yes thats combined city/highway. EVEN Trucks by 2015 will HAVE to get 32mpg combined in order to be sold on American soil. I?m not saying Electric is the way to go. but how well do they perform up here in Montana with 30? of snowfall a year??where do we put the Block Heater when the temps drop to -30 degrees??and do they have Heaters/AC for summer and winter driving?..      I would LOVE nothing more than to get an EV vehicle but lets be reasonable, I make 40,000 a year and to buy a car that costs 30-50k is just stupid to me. Houses up here are going for 150k-200k, Id rather put a nice down payment on some land than pay that kind of money for an electric car. Id rather have a corolla/civic/echo/focus for 1/2 the price. Plus i know it will start at 30 below in my driveway when a blizzard hits. Until these prices drop the average ?Joe? like myself will never put one in the driveway until the year 2050 or 2060 when the Internal Combustion Engine is in a museum!..If you leave your EV plugged in then you can pre-heat (or air-condition) the cabin and batteries using grid power.   Even better than a block heater that warms only your engine.  Once you start driving an EV the batteries give off heat which can be used to help heat the cabin.  EVs are starting to use heat pumps which is a much more efficient way to heat and cool the cabin...Right now the Nissan LEAF is $21,300 including the federal subsidy.  Prices will keep falling...Compare your Corella to the LEAF, not a luxury car like the Tesla S...People compare EVs to the average US car, ~25 MPG, and to the Prius. ~50 MPG.  Both are valid comparisons as long as they are clear which they are using...The federal standard of 50 MPG is for ?fleet average?.  To hit that mark car manufacturers will have to include a lot of EVs to make up for lower mileage larger cars.  Unless they are all EV/PHEVs by then, which is likely...An EV with snow tires is likely to do better in snow than an ICEV ? it will be heavier.  Better traction.  And once we start getting intelligent four wheel drive like the Mercedes has then nothing will be better in snow...If you do the math you?ll see that an EV is cheaper to drive over the life of the car than an ICEV.  Cost per mile is one quarter to one half as much.  Maintenance costs are close to zero.  (No oil changes, no mechanical stuff to service and replace.  Much less brake wear.)..Set up a spreadsheet and compare a LEAF with a Corella or Civic.  You may be surprised to see that it will cost you more to drive a gasmobile than an EV...FWIW, it?s basically impossible to get 50 mph without making a hybrid.  Before all cars are EVs, all cars will be hybrids.  And if you?re making a hybrid, you might as well make a plug-in hybrid...Don?t worry about a block heater, you don?t need one for an electric car.  Now, a block heater is powered by electricity, right?  Then you need to plug your car in ..whether it?s electric or not!..Heating and A/C in an electric car is powered by, again, electricity...So basically the only issue for you is the upfront price of the car.  If the Leaf has enough range for you, you?re golden.  Otherwise get a Volt?..It seems you are one of those anti-EV evangelists that go all over the internet looking for articles and try to inject you half baked theories trying to scare future EV buyers. The fact is that most of the people who come and comment here are EV lovers, like myself. Your comments are not doing any impact, as matter of fact those comments are starting to become pointless. Yes, we understand you believe in the oil industry. We Don?t. sir go right ahead and use your gas guzzing car, feel free to fill it up! and take a 500mi trip..great~!. But, please dont try to cover the sun with you tumb, by trying to say that EV are more polluting than gasoline cars. That is a non-sense myth...This is simply not true.  Wind power is more available at night, when people are most likely to charge their cars,  and it is very cheap.  By going to a real time pricing plan you can charge your car for 2 to 3 cents per kilowatt and you will be encouraging the development of wind farms.  You will also be helping to put coal plants out of business...Wind probably won?t stay that cheap.  It?s cheap now because there is little demand at the time wind farms are often the most productive.  What?s often happening is that coal and nuclear plants are forced to underbid wind because they can?t shut down and have to sell their power even at a loss.  They?ve got to go low enough to get under the wind subsidy and force wind to curtail its output...As EVs come on the grid demand for late night power will increase and it?s likely rates will rise to about the point where wind can make a profit.  Since new wind is likely to be in the 3 to 5 cent range and a few pennies have to be added for transmission, distribution and profit I would expect nighttime rates to hit around 8 cents.  Perhaps there will be enough profit in selling peak hour power to let wind cut their price a bit, but I don?t think 2 to 3 cents will hold...And, remember, the 2.2 cent subsidy is almost certain to go away.  That is currently helping lower the price of nighttime electricity...?..Eight  cents for charging would still be a sweet price.  Like running a 50 mile per gallon gasmobile on $1.20/gallon fuel...I would include a list of current Federal, state, & other incentives to lower prices...Tesla has a future cost of battery prices of around $150 per kWh...Bottom of fact page for S model...An approximate cost per mile (cost of car / range )..An approximate cost of ownership..Thanks. Will try to get around to digging up as much info on incentives as possible...You use confusing terms.  PEV is Plug-in electric vehicle ? generic term that means all plug-in vehicles (all electric and plug-in hyrid electric vehicle (PHEV).  You try to indicate that PEV means PHEV only?it does not!  Hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) DOES NOT HAVE A PLUG CONNEVTION!  It is the run of the mill hybrid like the standard prius that has been out there for 10 years plus...I?m well aware of the differences you write about here. Will review the text to see if there is some confusion...was very off & confusing ? not sure what was going on when i initially wrote that segment. fixed...If I may humbly suggest some horizontal rules between the pictures and associated range/efficiency ratings. It?s a bit confusing which numbers go with what picture...will try to clean things up soon. thnx..Pingback: ..()..Pingback: ..()..Pingback: ..()..Pingback: ..()..Pingback: ..()..Pingback: ..()..Pingback: ..()..Pingback: ..()..Pingback: ..()..Pingback: ..()..Hi guys?..Thanks for another great article...Regards..Johaar..ps the updates received are really appreciated?keep it up ...Greatly appreciate it, thanks! Such comments make my day, or week ??..Pingback: ..()..Pingback: ..()..If you?re going to develop content in this page then you?ll need NYT style navigation/table of contents.?..I?d really like to see EV battery recycling topics covered. I?m a cleantech fan and I find EV battery recycling worrisome.?..Thanks ? yeah, need to figure out how that works (or get someone who does). have another potential/likely solution, too...EV battery recycling ? good topic. I don?t have much info on that, so would need to do some digging. Let me know if you?ve got anything...I?ve read some stuff about it and it sounds a bit ugly. The bottom line seems to be that as we reduce the cost of batteries we also reduce the value of batteries (by definition) and thereby recycling becomes unprofitable. Unprofitable recycling, without mandatory recycling laws means that all these batteries get buried in landfills..?..Still, I?m more concerned about carbon than old batteries in landfills, but it?s important to be informed when people ask questions about this type of thing.?..As a reader of cleantechnica, I rely on cleantechnica articles to be well researched, cited (please do this as much as possible), and accurate. I don?t want to preach false gospel?...If we end up using lithium-ion batteries, the lithium will have value. ?It?s likely more concentrated than lithium ?in the wild?...It is possible that we will have to add a small charge to all sorts of products in order to make their recycling more profitable than dumping them in landfills. ?That is not something specific to batteries...Very good point. And i agree, on all fronts...Batteries won?t likely decrease in cost because we use less expensive materials, more likely due to more efficient manufacturing. ?..I did run across a claim a couple hours ago that it was cheaper to mine lithium than to recover it from used batteries. ?That could be the case and if it is then one practice might be to isolate used electrolyte for future extraction. ??..A properly designed landfill might be a future efficient mine...Or bite the bullet and charge a recycling fee to even things out.??..Lithium should be lower in price till, everyone has a EV till then they can recycle it...Even if battery cost will decrease, recycling still makes a good sense because lithium, cobalt and other materials are (probably) easier to recover from batteries than from Earth crust as raw material. Tesla already stated they use battery recycling because it is cheaper source of raw material (which can be sold to battery manufacturers) than mine new raw materials...Tesla Motors point of view:....Thanks for the link. That?s good news to hear from Tesla. Anyways, carbon is the problem so battery waste is secondary...tell that to the idiots of the world.. ??..I don?t think cost of recycling will be a problem, as typical present car batteries are much cheaper and they are recycled now...even with cheaper batteries the lithium needed to make them is still very expensive to source, so recycling will be mandatory just to keep production rates up!..The Lithium can be separated but unfortunately it is a fairly messy process, but still far less so then mining fresh!..Life cycle wise it is still all round better then even the best ice!..late to the show but a importent thing to mention...There?s not that much lithium in EV batteries.  Four kilograms in the Nissan Leaf batteries.  And bought in large quantity it?s not expensive. That makes a problem for recycling EV batteries, the extracted lithium would be more expensive than ?virgin? lithium...Tesla point of view:....Thanks!..Lead-acid batteries have been the single most recycled product since they were first used in automobiles, and they are still being nearly 100% recycled.  The issue is HOW they get recycled and by whom.  The process has shifted to the 3rd world where it gets ugly, but the truth remains that almost all lead-acid vehicle batteries are recycled, but perhaps not under ideal conditions for workers...There are not enough EV batteries to worry about yet. ?But let?s see how it might play out?...When EV batteries decline to the point where they hold only an 80% charge some people will want to swap them out...Utilities want those ?80%? batteries. ?They will rack them up in inexpensive real estate and use them for grid smoothing and storage. ?..Then when they are truly worn out they will be recycled. ?Toyota already has a recycling system for their Prius hybrid batteries. ?And we commonly recycle lead acid batteries. ?Lead-acids are one of our most successively recycled products...It?s hard to say exactly how the process will work out. ?We?re years away from having enough used up EV batteries to be concerned. ?It would seem that if people are already planning options then we shouldn?t be overly concerned...We don?t yet know the dominate battery chemistry. ?Will we be recovering the lithium from lithium-ion batteries or will be be separating the materials in zinc-air batteries? ?Or will the electrolyte of choice be sodium-ion? ?..?..From a couple years back?..As i?m reading this comment, I?m remembering another where someone said batteries had the leading recycling rate. Something to look up / verify, but it?s clear that many people know batteries don?t go to the landfill and should be recycled. Sort of common sense now...Not to say everyone has common sense? but, by definition, most people do. ??..Yes, someone did say that...?Lead-acid batteries are the environmental success story of our time. More than 98 percent of all battery lead is recycled. Compared to 55% of aluminum soft drink and beer cans, 45% of newspapers, 26% of glass bottles and 26% of tires, lead-acid batteries top the list of the most highly recycled consumer product...The lead-acid battery gains its environmental edge from its closed-loop life cycle. The typical new lead-acid battery contains 60 to 80 percent recycled lead and plastic.?..EV batteries are nade of modules, each of which conbtains cells...In a swap-able battery concept the battery owner (service provider, not the customer) will take those 80%ers  off the rack, and will send them for remodelling with newer, higher density modules, alllowing for longer trips and less swaps. The modules will then be sold for large arrays of cheap storage, for home business or utility, especially solar utilities. It will take many years before those cells will actually be recycled..Patrick, most of the late life cycle batteries will be used for stationary energy storage for micro-grid home systems. Afterward they are 100% dismantles and 90+% recycleable...Geese? you are so good at this. Motorcycles next? mike d ..haha.. ??  (blush)..was thinking about motorcycles, scooters, and electric bikes while doing this one. looks like a much bigger project, but the vehicles are even cleaner. worthwhile one, i think. if you?ve got any info to share on those, drop the links!! ??..Zachary, Absolutely amazing information.  Thanks for sharing, please keep them coming! ??..Way to put the info out there! ..Thanks!..Why is the GM SPARK not mentioned? It is supposed to be the range leader of mid size and priced EVs !..Also you would think all EV makers would offer 2 or 3 ranges of EV battery systems like Tesla does ? Maybe next year.as batteries continue to improve.  Note thermal management of the batteries make them last much longer, life of vehicle ! ..PS always lease EVs since they change so fast and keep dropping in cost...gross oversight. will add...I just realized why it wasn?t included. It doesn?t come up until summer.

Worth its luxury-car price tag: Hasselblad?s new H6D camera - Yahoo ????

?? Yahoo ???? ???Worth its luxury-car price tag: Hasselblad?s new H6D camera?? What do the Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, Marilyn Monroe, Steve Jobs, David Bowie, and NASA moon landings all have in common? They, and other notable figures and events, have been photographed with a Hasselblad. Its cameras, hand-made in Sweden, are some of the most prized medium-format cameras sought by photographers, particularly those who shoot portraits or expansive landscapes. The company, which is celebrating its 75th anniversary this year, is introducing a completely new digital medium-format camera that combines heritage with modern photography needs. Let?s get this out of the way: the new H6D, as with previous Hasselblads, is expensive ? well-equipped mid-size car expensive. It?s available in two models: a 50-megapixel CMOS (H6D-50c, 22,900 euros, or $25,900, available this month) and a larger, 100-megapixel CMOS (H6D-100c, 28,900 euros, or $32,600, available in June), and lenses aren?t included. When you put your hands on one, you can feel the quality craftsmanship (even the name sounds pricey, not to mention how it makes any amateur feel like a professional). But like a luxury car, it?s packed with the components required for today?s digital photography. ?We live in today?s world,? Hasselblad CEO Perry Oosting said during the camera?s official unveiling in New York City. ?We are not 75 years old, we are 75 years young.? Related: Drone maker DJI buys a stake in high-end camera maker Hasselblad With the H6D, Hasselblad says the H-series has been completely rebuilt. Besides the Sony-developed sensors, the new camera has a wider range of shutter speeds (60 minutes to 1/2,000th of a second, using lenses with new exposure unit), increased sensitivity (ISO 100-6,400 in 50c, ISO 64-12,800 in 100c), a USB 3.0 Type-C connector (seven times faster than the Firewire 800 used in the previous H5D), dual card slots (SD and CFast), HDMI-out, and Wi-Fi (2.4 and 5GHz). The three-inch, high-definition (920k pixels) rear touch-LCD is very bright, and features a new icon-based graphical user interface; navigating through screens and scrolling through and selecting settings is as buttery smooth as using a high-end smartphone. In live view mode, the display has a high frame rate of 30 frames per second (fps). We wish all new digital cameras featured an LCD as intuitive and well designed. While the camera is geared toward photography, Hasselblad has added 4K video recording in the 100c and Full HD in the 50c (at 30 fps),; however, the company places less emphasis on video. Hasselblad uses the same iconic modular system design as in the past 14 years (the digital back could be used on Hasselblad film cameras). It?s large and heavy (more than 2,000 grams), but the big pistol grip provides good ergonomics that makes it feel more portable than it would suggest. Paul Claesson, a Hasselblad tech support manager, said Hasselblad?s ergonomics are the ?best in the industry? in terms of medium format. In addition to a top monochrome LCD, there?s a quality viewfinder with diopter control. In our brief hands-on, we had no issues photographing a model using the H6D-50c in our hands, allowing us to move around freely versus fixing it on a tripod. There?s enough surface area to grab onto, so it never felt we would drop it, but we can see how our arms would get tired after some extended use. Related: Check out the Hasselblad family here The enhanced specs allow the H6D to shoot even higher quality medium-format photos ? the type of photos you would use in glossy magazines or photo books, or print out as posters, or use in any situation that calls for the best photos you can shoot. Full-frame cameras already do a great job, so you can imagine what medium-format delivers. Indeed, we didn?t have to put too much effort to shoot some really amazing quality portraits. Settings were easy to adjust, thanks to the new GUI. In a mock studio setup, we photographed a model from a good distance using a 100mm lens. A sample shot with the H6D-50c and 100mm lens at f/5.6, ISO 100, and 1/1,600th of a second shutter speed, without post-editing. Click to view in its full size (8,272 x 6,200). Although it was compressed from RAW to JPEG, you can still see great details when viewed in full. Digital Trends When we reviewed the photos using a an older version of Hasselblad?s Phocus software (the company also announced a new version 3.0 that has a new interface), not only did they look sharp and with great coloring, but when we zoomed in 100 percent, we could see the details on the model?s face. If you had to crop the image, you?re going to retain a lot of information and still be able to use the images at large sizes. Even after converting to JPEG, the resulting image retained a lot of the details despite the compression. The camera has 15 steps of dynamic range, and the amount of data between highlight and shadow that you can record is incredible, Claesson said. Cropped from full size. Digital Trends Image quality is top drawer, but unless you?re an artist or professional photographer, the H6D isn?t practical for everyone else. Even if you could afford the price of the body plus lenses, it?s not a flexible everyday camera. The camera shoots uncompressed RAW, and a 16GB card will only hold an average of 240 (50c) or 120 images (100c); of course, higher capacity cards are preferred, although studio photographers will have it tethered to a Mac or PC. So why should you care? Well, if you are paying to have expensive portraits taken ? whether it?s a wedding, family photo, newborn, or any memorable moment ? you want to make sure the photographer you hire?is using a good camera. If it?s one of these new Hasselblads, then you?re sure to get the best quality images a camera is capable of capturing. If an opportunity to use or rent one arises, definitely give it a try, because this camera turns any casual photographer into an artist. Or, at least make you feel like one for a day. Hasselblad has a 1,000,000-exposure guarantee. If you own the previous H5D, you could trade it in for $11,500, and apply it to the new camera.

In a mock studio setup, we photographed a model from a good distance using a 100mm lens...A sample shot with the H6D-50c and 100mm lens at f/5.6, ISO 100, and 1/1,600th of a second shutter speed, without post-editing. Click to view in its full size (8,272 x 6,200). Although it was compressed from RAW to JPEG, you can still see great details when viewed in full...When we reviewed the photos using a an older version of Hasselblad?s Phocus software (the company also announced a new version 3.0 that has a new interface), not only did they look sharp and with great coloring, but when we zoomed in 100 percent, we could see the details on the model?s face. If you had to crop the image, you?re going to retain a lot of information and still be able to use the images at large sizes. Even after converting to JPEG, the resulting image retained a lot of the details despite the compression. The camera has 15 steps of dynamic range, and the amount of data between highlight and shadow that you can record is incredible, Claesson said...Cropped from full size...Image quality is top drawer, but unless you?re an artist or professional photographer, the H6D isn?t practical for everyone else. Even if you could afford the price of the body plus lenses, it?s not a flexible everyday camera. The camera shoots uncompressed RAW, and a 16GB card will only hold an average of 240 (50c) or 120 images (100c); of course, higher capacity cards are preferred, although studio photographers will have it tethered to a Mac or PC...So why should you care? Well, if you are paying to have expensive portraits taken ? whether it?s a wedding, family photo, newborn, or any memorable moment ? you want to make sure the photographer you hire?is using a good camera. If it?s one of these new Hasselblads, then you?re sure to get the best quality images a camera is capable of capturing. If an opportunity to use or rent one arises, definitely give it a try, because this camera turns any casual photographer into an artist. Or, at least make you feel like one for a day...Hasselblad has a 1,000,000-exposure guarantee. If you own the previous H5D, you could trade it in for $11,500, and apply it to the new camera.

Higher gross in less time? Get the "must have" new car price tool | Inventory+
http://inventoryplus.dealersocket.com/2015/04/27/higher-gross-in-less-time-get-the-must-have-new-car-price-tool/

There?s a lot of noise going on about software and tools that promise to do your job for you. As great as that sounds--and as good as inventory technology

There?s a lot of noise going on about software and tools that promise to do your job for you. As great as that sounds?and as good as inventory technology has become?key challenges remain. For almost every dealer, perhaps the biggest challenge is figuring out how to price cars to stay competitive with the online market, while not giving away your gross in the process. Not only that, but how to do it hundreds of times over...This is where almost every tool in the market falls short. Good inventory is hard to replace, and getting someone in the door on a low price is not always the best strategy to maximize profit. You can?t always make it up on the back-end if you gave it all away to get them in the door. You can avoid this and develop best practices with the right technology that includes three core but basic ?must haves?:..Must have balance between competition and profitability..The key is to be able to price really well, to balance for both competitiveness and profitability, and then do it dozens, or even hundreds of times, per day?accurately and compliantly. To do it well, you should factor a day?s supply and incentives as well as market conditions for every VIN you price. The downside of not doing this well for your entire inventory is fewer leads, less traffic and lower grosses. If you price too high, or at MSRP, then people won?t engage, and if you price too low, you?ll give away gross profit that you don?t need to lose...Must have total integration capability..So what does it take for you to be successful at your store? Constantly turning over your inventory? Constantly maintaining high average grosses? Today, the only way to do all this is to leverage the advance data power of an integrated solution. A good tool should be easy to use and quickly and automatically scale across your entire operation. It should perform repetitive tasks in an instant, optimize every price, and give you more time to do what you want to do, and then to be able to enjoy the rewards of overall better performance...Must have an interface that?s easy to use..Inventory+ New Car Pricing tool is designed to handle the complexity of pricing and manage the importance of integration in an easy-to-use package. That?s the value of innovation through integration, with the industry?s best market and transaction data and factory integrations powering the software. It?s been developed over years working in partnership with top performing dealers, taking into consideration almost every challenge that dealers confront in the business today. Inventory+ New Car Pricing module can change the way you approach your daily workload. It will help you optimize your pricing, and by tying in with current programs and offers, it will save you a massive amount of time, time that you need to do those things that matter most... ......?2015 DealerSocket, Inc. | All Rights Reserved. .. | ..

http://www.mccluskeychevrolet.com/negotiate-best-car-price/

When you are looking for a new vehicle, your local Chevy dealer in Ohio sells the best vehicles?at some of the best prices. You can find a great car that y

You don't have any saved vehicles!..Look for this link on your favorites:..Once you've saved some vehicles, you can view them here at any time...When you are looking for a new vehicle, your local .. sells the best vehicles?at some of the best prices. You can find a great car that you?ll love and that will fit your budget. You won?t need to negotiate because the deals will be so good...However, knowing how to negotiate for the best car price is a good skill to have. Here?s how you can negotiate for the best deal:..You can?t even know what constitutes a ?good deal? if you don?t know ..the going rate for the car. You?ll need to find out what the value is of the car you are looking for and to understand the range of prices that are available. Since so many factors go into determining the value of a car ? such as condition, mileage, location, and features ? you won?t be looking at a static number but will have a range for your value...The lower the car?s price is on that range, the better the deal you?re getting...If you can find a better price at another dealership, you can use that information as leverage to get a better bargain. Make sure you have evidence of the price. That could include a link to the car on the dealer?s website, a circular, or a written offer. Not only might the dealership you are shopping at match that price, but it might even undercut it...There are a lot of ways to ask for a better price or to inspire the dealer to offer one, such as falling silent when the price is announced or making a simple statement like, ?That?s a bit more than we expected.? Negotiating strategies are complex, and you should read about the different options to choose one that you are most comfortable with and that best matches your style...What?s more important than the strategy you use is how confident you are in using it. You need to practice your strategy with a friend of family member before you head out to shop. Once you get to the dealership, you?ll be feeling confident and ready to get results...Of course, when you shop at a dealership like McCluskey Chevrolet, you can be sure you are always getting the best prices on the best used cars Cincinnati has to offer.

Renault Kwid Price in India, Renault Kwid features, Renault Kwid images, mileage comparison, review, video, Kwid news and Explore more on Renault Kwid.

Renault?s small car with SUV-like stance, ?the Kwid? has taken the A segment by storm with a huge demand among budget buyers. Priced competitively, Kwid has broken the barriers when it comes to design ditching the mundane looks.?..Under the hood, Renault Kwid gets two engine options - ?the regular 800cc engine, and the all-new more powerful 1.0L petrol motor. Interiors are styled in tandem with mass hatchbacks, albeit on feature front, Kwid is a notch above than rivals...To be eligible for making booking on CarAndBike.com website, following should be complied with:..There are no reviews yet..Renault Kwid has come across as a serious competition to long reigning Alto series from MSI that has its root deep within the domestic market. In this price band, Kwid is a worthy contender in the budget space. The relatively larger Kwid comes in as a breath of fresh air in the first time buyer segment that had only a handful of options. Renault did take its time to venture into mini hatchback division, but it came up with the right product. The most amusing thing about Kwid is its design and size. Apart from looking big, the hatchback offers ample room inside. Even the feature list is impressive considering that it belongs to A segment. Although there are certain loop holes to cut down on the cost but that is something common in other hatches in the league. Power is derived from 800cc and 1000cc units mated to the conventional manual transmission. The 1.0 litre engine is currently available only on the high-end RXT and RXT(O) trims...An AMT version of the hatchback is underway and will be available on the recently launched 1.0 litre trim. To curb pricing, Renault will apparently build the automated manual transmission in-house.        ..Budget-hatchbacks are stereotyped to be petite vehicles adorning elementary design; Kwid on the other hand breaks this assumption. The square-shaped SUV like stance can give hatchback based crossovers a run for their money. Dimensionally, Kwid is the largest of its rivals measuring 3,679 mm long and 1579 mm wide. Moreover, 180 mm of ground clearance vouches for a better performance while on the go. The aggressive front profile is highlighted by C-shaped signature head lamps and bold structured front grille. Chunky fog lamp housings sit on the lower bumper. Body cladding on wheel arch and thick black side panels lend rugged look to the sides. Rear too has been styled impressively featuring integrated roof spoiler and distinctively designed tail lights. The 1.0 litre version is largely same as the 800cc variant except for the chequered flag pattern on the side decals, slightly larger ORVMs with dual tone colour and SCe badge on the tailgate. ?..Space is the upmost concern while talking about cabins and Kwid offers a comfortable space to passengers sitting in front. There is enough space at rear too, but the thigh support isn?t as good as it should have been. The dashboard and instrument cluster has been carved contemporarily. Cabin gets dual glovebox and cup-holders along with other cubby holes for storage purpose. Plastic quality could have been better; this is one area where the hatch misses out on, but nothing unusual for a mini hatchback belonging to budget segment.?..Renault has launched Kwid in petrol variants only with a choice 800cc and 1000cc units. The low capacity 800cc, petrol engine features three cylinders and 12 valves. Power and torque output for the 799cc petrol engine is 54 PS at 5678 RPM and 72 Nm at 4386 RPM respectively. The 1.0 litre engine puts out 67bhp and 91Nm torque and has improved NVH levels that in turn offer better ride quality. Both the engines come mated to the conventional five-speed manual gearbox and an AMT unit will be introduced on the 1.0 litre variant later. ?..It might not be packed with features, but it gets most of the features that are available in entry level B segment cars and some of the segment first features absent in rivals. Alloy wheels are missing on the outside, but it gets front fog lamps. Outside rear view mirror on the passenger side comes bereft of power adjusting and folding functions. Cabin features digital instrument cluster, sporty three-spoke steering wheel and dash-mounted AC vents in centre and side.?..The 660 kg kerb weight is the lowest in the segment. The power to weight ratio stands at 80.75 bhp/ton which hints at adept performance. The 0 to 100 kmph speed is achieved within 16.80 second (approximate figure) which may not be imposing but is fairly good as compared to arch rival Hyundai Eon. Fuel economy is promising especially for a petrol powered vehicle; the claimed mileage figure for Kwid is 25.17 kms in a litre.?..Renault gives an option of personalising Kwid as per the taste of owner. There are various packages on offer including smart chrome package, intense chrome package, luxury pack, outdoor pack, basic pack and essential pack. Starting with the chrome pack it comprises of chrome tailgate, front grille chrome garnish and gear shift chrome bezel. Intense chrome pack includes chrome work around fog lamps, weather deflector, head lamp eyeliner, bumper, bumper corner protector and tail lamps. Features like illuminated sill plate, designer cabin floor mat, front grille chrome garnish, gear shift chrome bezel, ambient light and designer car cover can be availed in the luxury pack. Outdoor pack on the other hand offers illuminated sill plate, roof rails, body side cladding, finisher on rear/front bumper, weather deflector and bumper corner protector. The basic pack as the name suggests has silver car cover, mud flaps and black cabin floor mat carpet on offing. And the essential pack comes with silver car cover, mud flaps, sill plates, roof rails, body side cladding and black cabin floor mat carpet. From the entertainment section, Kwid features a MediaNAV with segment first seven inch touchscreen display and roof mic exclusive to the range topping variant. Besides, the hatch comes with single DIN stereo with radio AM/FM, MP3 (available in trims positioned below top-spec variant), Bluetooth audio streaming & handsfree telephony, USB port, AUX-in port and a 12 V power socket among others.?..For retarding power, Renault has employed disc brakes up front and drum brakes at rear. The engine feels sluggish initially but picks pace, supply of torque and power is fair, however one might encounter disparity in power delivery. Overall, the new 799cc, three cylinder aluminium petrol engine yields decent performance by all standards. Ride quality is in line with rest of the Renault cars; body roll is insignificant thanks to the suspension set up that works in the favour of Kwid.?..Being a budget car, the vehicle misses out on a number of safety equipment such as anti-lock-braking system along with electronic brakeforce distribution. Driver airbag is offered as optional on the top-spec variant, fog lamps are provided in front only. The hatch comes with remote keyless entry with central locking. Other safety features on board are engine immobilizer, intermittent front wiper and auto wiping while washing, seat belts in front and rear and high mounted stop lamp among others.?..In terms of comfort and convenience, Kwid gets almost all the fitments that are usually available in budget cars such as power windows are available in front missing out on the rear windows. There is an air conditioner along with heater. ?Front seats features reclining and longitudinal adjust functions. On board trip meter, rear parcel tray and cabin lighting with timer and fade out function are available in top-spec variant only. Electric power steering is again present on the high end trims only.?..Alloy wheels are missing, instead the hatch features black painted steel wheels mounted on the R13 155/80 radial tubeless tyres.?..A segment might have petite offerings, but this is a highly popular division in India roping in high volumes. The biggest challenge for Kwid is Maruti?s new Alto 800 which has been altered in terms of design. What works for Maruti despite the fundamental styling and minimal feature list is the service it provides post sales and easy maintenance. Next in line comes Hyundai?s Eon which was the first car in the segment to defy the elementary styling. Interior styling is the best of all, but Kwid has various other parameters that make it a desirable hatch in its segment.?..?..&COPY; Copyright Fifth Gear Ventures Ltd 2016. All rights reserved.

Whose side are those new-car pricing sites really on? | Clark Howard
http://www.clark.com/whose-side-are-those-new-car-pricing-sites-yours-o

New-car pricing websites offer a wealth of info for shoppers. But are they concealing the most important fact about pricing?

.... ...... /.. /....Share This Article..Kelley Blue Book (kbb.com), Edmunds.com, Cars.com, and TrueCar.com are four key websites new-car shoppers visit. They provide us with lots of valuable information. Specs on the cars we?re considering. Reviews of their pluses and minuses. Cost of ownership estimates between competing vehicles. And more. When we?re ready to buy, we turn to them for pricing data and negotiating advice...They?re all for-profit corporations that get gazillions of visitors each month. And they get virtually all their revenue from the auto business, but not a penny from you. Their main revenue sources, which can vary by site, are: (1) advertising dollars from automakers and dealers; (2) small referral fees from dealers when visitors click through for price quotes; and (3) richer ?finders? fees? when those referrals turn into sales. (A common number: about $300, which is built into the price you pay.)..Those sites are ?third-party lead generators,? conduits for conveying shoppers to dealers, who turn them into buyers. They recommend target prices you should aim for and send you to dealers in their networks that will sell at those prices, based importantly on ?what others have paid.?..They provide a useful service for consumers who?d rather have all their molars pulled than negotiate the price of a new car. But they?re in business to help dealers sell cars profitably, not to help get you the best price. And the dealers in their networks know that you?ve been told by online ?experts? you trust that with the prices they recommend, you?ll drive that car home with a smile on your face...I?ve spent 20+ years dealing with over 130,000 consumers whose objective was to get the best price available. And knowing the truth about the inverted invoice/retail price relationship, they approach the purchase process with a plan for getting that price .....They know they?re shopping for a commodity, and that the only negotiating leverage comes from making sellers compete on price for their business. They do that from their home or office, not by haggling in car stores. And given .., they know there can be a wide spread between the high and low bids. (It?s rare to have less than a $1,000 difference on a $25,000 car if there are six to ten dealers participating. And the spread can be much greater because dealers will sell cars at a loss to stay on track to reach a multi-month sales target.)..Getting price proposals from only two or three dealers in a site?s network isn?t a negotiation, it?s a capitulation. If I were one of those dealers and you were coming over to buy at my offer price, I?d send a chauffeur-driven limousine to make sure you didn?t stop at another dealership on the way...I presented the evidence to their senior executives in a November 27, 2012 USA TODAY ?open and candid? automotive roundtable discussion on ?whether online car shopping services are believable and are relevant in today?s market.? (A Consumer Reports exec..was also there. I?ll discuss that organization in a subsequent article.)..I distributed .., which illustrates for 47 popular models of 23 brands how the visible gross profit has been cut systematically, year after year, since 1995. You could have heard a pin drop. No one there was aware of that upheaval in the automaker-dealer financial relationship, though that pricing data had been in their information wheelhouse every day for over a decade! If it had teeth, it would have bitten them...At one point I challenged their ?pay what others paid? recommendations with, ?You?re treating consumers like they?re idiots. Why would anyone pay close to an average price, when, by definition, it means that about half the people got a better price ? maybe a much better price??..The Kelley Blue Book representative?s reply was,..?Overwhelmingly, our market research shows that consumers ultimately don?t want the best price. They just want a fair price.? (No one disagreed.) He later said that a fair price ?means that when I tell my neighbor what I paid for the car, I won?t be embarrassed.? (No one disagreed.)..TrueCar?s Executive VP echoed that claim, saying, ?We have data to support exactly what he said. We do post-purchase surveys of 100% of our consumers, and the ones who pay the least are the most dissatisfied.?..That research has the ring of truth. Most folks believe that to get the best price, they must walk into car store after car store and spend an hour or two haggling in each one. If that were true, I wouldn?t want the best price, either...Do those statements accurately describe your objective when you buy a new car? Are you sitting there thinking, ?I sure hope I get a price that?s at least in the ballpark of what others are paying??.. on that discussion, as well as .....1. Knowing how the car business really works today would create significant doubt about the value of their advice. For decades, you?ve believed that the invoice price is a bona fide dealer cost estimate, and that a selling price close to that number would be a good deal. That belief chain is the foundation for the target prices they recommend. Knowing the truth, you?d quickly see that foundation as a house of cards.?..2. ?Revealing the truth would make their network dealers madder than a mosquito trapped in mannequin warehouse and dry up their revenue stream...My mission is to spread that truth to every new-car shopper...They deserve praise for the information they provide to help consumers choose vehicles that best fit their needs. And they provide a useful service to shoppers who abhor the negotiating process so much that they?re willing to pay ?an average price,? including their ?finder?s fee,? to avoid it. But their business models are built to protect dealers? profitability, not to help you get the best price. Given their industry-dependent relationship, telling you the truth would be financial suicide...They have nothing to offer knowledgeable consumers, who know the invoice price is a bloated imposter and that the way to get the best price is to make several dealers compete for their business...What?s my opinion?..Let?s just say I agree with this Matthew 6:24 quote from the New Testament:..?No one can serve two masters.?..Part 1: ..Part 3: ..Part 4: ..Part 5: ..? 2016 Fans 1st Media.

Those tend to sell at full price, and early buyers of a new model also tend to be people who check all the options boxes...The transaction price boost also came partly from the shift in sales mix in the month in favor of pricier trucks and SUVs, including even hot sales for expensive full-size SUVs, such as General Motors' full-size Chevrolet Suburban, GMC Yukon and Cadillac Escalade...USA TODAY..Low gas prices, loan rates cut car ownership costs.."Prices were up across most of the industry, but we are seeing some of the greatest increases in the truck segments," said Alec Gutierrez, senior analyst for Kelley Blue Book.  "Full-size trucks were particularly strong, up 4.5%, while mid-size trucks were up 3.5%.  Incentive spending on trucks also has been lighter this year, indicating a great market for these units right now."..In addition to market factors, prices are moving generally up to cover the additional costs of more fuel-efficient drivetrains required by tightening federal fuel economy standards, and the costs of sophisticated safety gear, such as automatic braking to prevent a collision, both required for top safety ratings and becoming expected by many buyers...USA TODAY..Top 20 best-selling vehicles in April: Jeep leaps ahead..Note: The KBB estimate does not include the variety of consumer incentives that may be applied, some of which may be regional and not apply for all buyers...Here are the major mainstream automakers' average transaction prices in April, including all brands sold by each company, and the amount the average price rose or fell in April from the month a year ago:..?

But will the people who need the technology the most ever be able to afford it? Not anytime soon...[Image: Flickr user ..]..You?ve seen the video on YouTube: Steve Mahan, a visually impaired, conservatively dressed, white-haired gentleman with a walking cane and Ben Hogan-style hat on his head, climbs behind the wheel of one of Google?s nautical blue-colored self-driving Toyota Prius. He makes a "Run for the Border." Then Mahan, who has lost 95% of his eyesight, picks up his dry cleaning, takes a joy ride around his middle class looking community while munching on tacos. Then he returns to his driveway, exits the car (tacos in hand), and heads off camera toward the house, safe and sound, never having touched a steering wheel, brake or accelerator...The clip is amusing and tremendously uplifting?showing how autonomous driving technology can empower a person, giving them a sense of independence and freedom to do whatever they want, when they want to do it. Problem is, most Americans (disabled or not) can?t afford such a vehicle, even if one were available, let alone the advanced driving assist systems that are available to the public now, and serve as the building blocks of autonomous automobiles..., the average American spends around $30,000 on a new car or light truck. In contrast, Interest.com?s 2013 Car Affordability Study says that the average American can only afford to spend $20,806 on a car. The featured Prius, which starts at around $24,000, is optioned up with a $75,000 to $80,000 Velodyne LIDAR system, visual and radar sensors estimated to cost about $10,000, and a nearly $200,000 GPS array. Not to mention the cost of the driving computer and software. Put into context: The staid-looking Toyota Prius Mahan "drove" around in the video costs more than a Ferrari 599. At $320,000, that?s an exclusive purchase, and well above the mean cost of a car, truck or SUV...So, who, exactly are self-driving cars for? Proponents to make fantastic claims about autonomous vehicles and ADAS technologies, then automakers and other advanced safety system developers turn around and charge exorbitant prices for their creations, failing to factor in the need for mass adoption in the plan for success...Fairness aside, cost will be an issue for driverless and self-driving car technologies well into the future. To provide all the vehicle electronic functionality, automakers must add complexity and unnecessary weight (wires, sensors and other components/modules) to a car. This can affect the cost of the vehicle, its performance, and how much it costs to keeping the vehicle on the road... ..According to a recent study, "Emerging Technologies: Autonomous Cars?Not If, But When," IHS Automotive forecasts that the price for the self-driving technology will add between $7,000 and $10,000 to a car?s sticker price in 2025, a figure that will drop to around $5,000 in 2030 and about $3,000 in 2035, the year when the report says most self-driving vehicles will be operated completely independent from a human occupant?s control... .."It?s a chicken and egg thing, the have?s versus the have not?s," says John Absmeier, director for Delphi's Silicon Valley Innovation Center. "When people start buying the technology the cost will come down, but the cost has to come down before most people will buy it. Consequently, [SDC technology] will come in through the luxury, high-end market and penetrate down as economies of scale kick in.".. ..The incremental decreases in cost are projected based on the adoption of the technology (i.e., projected increases in sales of cars with SDC technology). IHS predicts that annual sales between 2025 and 2035 will jump from 230,000 to 11.8 million. That's about 9% of all the world's auto sales in 2035. Seven million of those 11.8 million vehicles will rely on a mix of driver input and autonomous control, with the remaining 4.8 million vehicles relying entirely on computers to get around. Combined with vehicles from previous model years, IHS also forecasts that there will be 54 million autonomous vehicles on the road by 2035. When will sales of autonomous cars outnumber those of conventional cars? IHS expects this tipping point to occur by 2050. By then, IHS says the majority of vehicles sold and those in use are likely to be autonomous, with conventional vehicles becoming increasingly rare...Companies like Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz have a leg up on the competition in this case simply because their clientele is more affluent. "Our customers demand the latest technologies and are willing to pay for them, especially when it comes to safety technologies," says Rupert Stadler, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Audi AG. "We are simply giving them what they want, and anticipating what the customer of tomorrow will demand from us."..However, more mainstream brands, such as Ford, are looking more pragmatically at the bottom line. "We are not jumping into the self-driving arena simply to prove we can make a vehicle that can pilot itself under controlled situations," says Paul Mascarenas, Chief Technical Officer and Vice President of Research and Advanced Engineering at Ford. "We know we can do that. We need to deliver it in the most efficient, cost-effective way possible, and still have an excellent user experience."..The consensus in the automobile industry is that Google?s idealistic approach to the driverless car won't bring the price of these technologies down far enough in price to make its car a mass-market proposition. So most outfits are working on less exotic but much cheaper approaches to the driverless problem: They?re looking at ways to consolidate and simplify the hardware..."We are looking into miniaturization, sensor fusion and integration of controllers, [to name a few technologies]," explains Ford?s Mascarenas. "Anything that will make the technology more accessible."..Delphi?s has been working on a new type of controller that takes into consideration all three of Ford?s concerns. Its "multi-domain controller" is designed to take all of the data collected?from the body and security of the vehicle up through the active safety systems ? and aggregate it into one controller, one processor that will then make the driving decisions and direct all the subsystems and sub-controllers in the vehicle. By combining all of the sensor inputs and processors into box, instead of hundreds, Delphi?s controller will bring down the weight of the vehicle (improving fuel efficiency and performance) as well as complexity of the system (making it easier to maintain.) In addition, it makes the vehicle cheaper to build; fewer ECUs and the corresponding wire harnesses to drive the costs up...Another popular target for most ADAS developers is the sensor array. Tesla?s Elon Musk believes the LIDAR/RADAR sensor approach is too expensive. "It?s better to have an optical system, basically cameras with software that is able to figure out what?s going on just by looking at things," he recently told Bloomberg...Mobileye, a technology firm headquartered in the Netherlands, is aiming to get most of the functionality into cars for much less, with equipment that cost hundreds of dollars, rather than the tens of thousands.  It currently focuses on helping cars avoid collisions and pedestrians, as well as drifting out of lanes ? most of the advanced safety features currently rolling out in higher end autos. The longer-term goal, is more ambitious: a semiautonomous vehicle that can handle many, but not all, driving functions without driver input. To that end, it has developed a low-cost alternative to expensive sensor arrays that uses a single camera and a "system-on-chip." It works as a third eye for the driver by supporting them in performing routine driving tasks (e.g., distance keeping, pedestrian identification, traffic-sign recognition) and provide timely warnings (e.g., lane departure warning, forward collision warning) in dangerous situations. Though he wouldn?t discuss exact prices has not been announced, Ziv Aviram, a co-founder and the company?s chief executive, told the New York Times that it is the "most cost-efficient system that?s out there." One thing is for certain, the optical approach is currently more accessible, and Mr. Aviram is working with three powerhouses in the autonomous business: BMW, General Motors, and Volvo...Driverless, self-driving, and autonomous driving technologies do have the potential to deliver improved safety and comfort for the driver and passengers, while reducing the vehicle?s impact on the environment around it and reducing the cost to the driver. But don?t expect to see a scene the like the one in Google?s video?where a blind neighbor drives by while munching a taco?anytime soon in your neighborhood. In reality, most people in Steve?s positionb who were head of household reported an annual household income of $25,550, according to the 2010 U.S. Census. Currently, the technology package in the Infiniti Q50 that includes adaptive cruise control, blind spot monitoring, lane keeping systems, and adaptive steering, costs an additional $6,600 above the base sticker price of around $37.000. Mercedes-Benz driver assist package costs around $3,000, but the base car costs just north of $92,000.

New Car Prices: MSRP, Invoice Price, Dealer Cost
http://www.car-buying-strategies.com/new-car-prices.html

An Internet exclusive! New vehicle price guides reveal Dealer Invoice Prices vs. True Dealer Cost, w/ hold back, MSRP and an explanation of how it all works together.

 refers to manufacturer's suggested retail price. It is the published amount that a car manufacturer advises dealers to charge. Of course, the MSRP is merely the starting point in negotiations at the dealership. In fact, many people disregard MSRP altogether while negotiating.....The MSRP, or sticker price, is typically listed on the spec sheet that's affixed to a new car. In some instances, it's not listed at all. Dealers sometimes omit the MSRP when a car is especially in demand. By not advertising the MSRP, the dealer may be able to start negotiations at a higher amount.....It should be noted that MSRP does not reflect the "out the door" amount that you should expect to pay. It doesn't include registration, taxes, destination charges or other fees. Although MSRPs are ostensibly used to protect consumers, they are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to getting a great price on a vehicle... - The invoice price of a new vehicle is the price on an invoice the manufacturer sends a dealer when they acquire a vehicle. many people believe that this is the true dealer cost of the vehicle, but in many cases - it is not, Invoice prices have hidden profit built into them such as dealer holdback and manufacturer to dealer incentives. (See below.) .. - Dealer holdback reflects a percentage of the MSRP or invoice price that is paid back to a dealer by the manufacturer. Manufacturers usually pay this withheld amount back quarterly, but practices do vary. Holdbacks came into widespread use a few years ago. They are used to improve dealer profits by inflating invoice prices. They primarily do that by reducing the gross profit of a sale. In turn, the salesperson who was involved in the transaction earns a lower commission.....Another reason that dealer holdbacks, which are usually about two to three percent of the MSRP, are so popular is because they allow dealers to offer special deals while still earning handsome profits. Dealers can legitimately say they are offering vehicles at invoice prices but recoup hundreds of dollars later.....While it's beneficial to be aware of dealer holdbacks, you probably won't have much luck using them during your negotiations. It's smart to know they exist, but dealers hold tightly to them. You can use them in a roundabout way to negotiate a lower price... .. - Dealer incentives are often referred to as factory-to-dealer incentives. They reduce the dealer's true cost to buy a vehicle. In some instances, those savings may be passed along to consumers. Dealer incentives are often offered on a regional basis in order to bolster sales for a specific model. Other times, they are used to reward dealers who reach a certain sales target.....Dealers are not required to pass these incentives on to consumers. If you can track down specific information about a current dealer incentive that's not being passed on to buyers, it may give you the leverage you need to get a better price. However, because these incentives often vary by region, it isn't always easy to pin them down successfully. It never hurts to keep your eyes peeled though....... In the vast majority of cases, regional ad fees are not negotiable. That's because they are usually itemized on dealer invoices, and they are a firm part of a dealer's cost. They are the way in which manufacturers recoup some of the expense of promoting and marketing specific models. When these fees appear on a dealer invoice, you can bet your bottom dollar that they will be on your sales contract too.....In some cases, however, the dealer invoice doesn't include these fees. If it doesn't, but they appear on your sales contract, you may have some wiggle room. It all depends on the specific dealer and on the amount that you are paying. Before you head to the dealership, go online to consult the many lists that outline regional advertising fees by manufacturer. They can help you get a better grasp about how much these fees come into play... .. - To arrive on dealer lots, new cars have to be transported from automobile manufacturing plants. The expense of doing so is charged to the dealer by the manufacturer, who then passes it along to the consumer. The total amount is usually several hundreds of dollars. As nice as it would be to somehow negotiate away these fees, it simply isn't possible. The amount differs depending on the model and the manufacturer, but it has nothing to do with how far the vehicle had to be transported... .. - Three of the most popular manufacturer rebates and incentives are designed to be passed along to consumers. Low-interest financing, cash rebates and special leases are all offered from time to time to stimulate sales. Sometimes, they are offered as first-time buyer specials, employee discounts, military discounts and other incentives.....These incentives reduce the net price of the vehicle. You can use an online calculator to determine whether a cash rebate, which can be applied as a down payment, or low-interest financing is better.....Now that these terms have been demystified, you should have a much easier time conducting research before buying the vehicle that you want... ..Invoice Price - Holdback - Rebates & Incentives (If any)= Dealer Cost..Take the Invoice price and subtract the holdback. (Percentages Below). Take this amount and subtract any manufacturer rebates. To get the rebates simply fill in a price quote from one of the recommended services listed - you will receive the rebate you are entitled to in your area. (If Any).. The price guides above do not include state taxes, license fees, or manufacturers Rebates. To calculate your on the road price, add you state taxes and License fee - then subtract your manufacturer rebate if any... Most rebates are subtracted from the "on the road" figure. In most cases, you can have the rebate if you are arranging your own financing or you are paying cash. If you decide to use the manufacturer?s low interest financing, you do not usually get the rebate. Ask your dealer for details.

Secrets about new-car prices can be found on window sticker

[]

What you pay represents more than just the aggregate cost of steel, glass, rubber, chrome and labor. But getting to that bottom line can be confusing...Here are some of the behind-the-scenes items that can affect the total price of your new car, truck or SUV:.. This is what "the dealership is presumed to have paid for the car," says Jeff Bartlett, deputy editor online, autos for Consumer Reports. But that price "may not reflect the cost to the dealership of acquiring that car," he says. One big reason is something called a "dealer holdback," which is a "percentage the manufacturer awards the dealership" for selling the car, he says. Typically, a holdback is about 2 percent to 3 percent of what the buyer pays for the auto, Bartlett says. "This insures that the dealer makes some money on the car."..With a little research, you can find dealer pricing data, but don't expect the dealer to show you the actual dealer invoice on the car you buy, he says...You can get the information at auto buyers' sites like Edmunds.com and Kelley Blue Book, as well as the Consumer Reports' New Car Price Reports, says Bartlett. "All the major sites update weekly," he says... The base price is often for a stripped down model. While there are some makers who will include a host of "extras" in the base price, many don't. On average, figure about $3,000 to $8,000 for the options included on the model you'll drive home, says Mike Caudill, auto expert for NADAguides.com... Sometimes you'll see a second window sticker, next to the main one from the manufacturer. It will detail anything the dealer has done to the car, from pin stripes to special after-market options. The cost of add-ons can reach into the thousands... Also called "manufacturer-to-dealer incentives" or "direct-to-dealer incentives." This is a short-term offer carmakers offer dealers to get them to sell certain models. This money is separate from the holdback, says Bartlett. Typically, amounts range from $500 to $1,000, but can go as high as $1,500, he says. And knowing about these incentives can put the buyer in a stronger bargaining position... Money that the carmaker or dealer can give the buyer. These price breaks can also include discounts for people who meet certain criteria -- military families, students, owners of certain auto brands, etc...Information on these can be found on the manufacturer's Web site... When the fee is listed but there's no breakdown of what exactly goes into "dealer prep," essentially they're saying, '"We'd like a few extra dollars,"' says Bartlett...Bankrate wants to hear from you and encourages thoughtful and constructive comments.

The Complete Guide To Buying A Used Car: How To Negotiate Prices  | Investopedia
http://www.investopedia.com/university/usedcar/negotiate-price.asp

So you've done your research, selected several makes and models of vehicles in your price range to test drive, test driven them and now you've narrowed your search for a used car down to just one vehicle. It's fun to drive, it's reliable and for the money it's about as close to perfect as you're going to get.

So you've done your research, selected several makes and models of vehicles in your price range to test drive, test driven them and now you've narrowed your search for a used car down to just one vehicle. It's fun to drive, it's reliable and for the money it's about as close to perfect as you're going to get. Now the only thing you need to do is pay the seller for it and accelerate off into the sunset. Simple, right? Sure, as long as you don't mind overpaying. (If you're planning on going for a new model rather than a used, check out ...)The interesting thing about used vehicles is that their prices are anything but concrete. No matter what the seller is asking, you can almost always get away with paying less. This is because used cars don't have the same exclusivity as new cars. They've seen miles, they've been through rough seasons and most importantly ? they depreciated in value the minute the original owner drove them off the lot. All of this adds up to leverage for the buyer. As a result, there is ..reason to pay sticker price for a used vehicle. ..Of course, it's easy to say that you won't pay sticker when you're reading this at home. Actually convincing your seller to accept a lower price is something else entirely. Though negotiating the price of a used car isn't difficult if you're buying through a private seller, it can be a daunting task if you're trying to talk down a dealership. If the latter applies to you, use this guide to help you stand your ground and successfully negotiate a lower price for your next car. ..A used vehicle is only worth what someone is willing to pay for it. Consequently, the first step towards negotiating a lower price for your next used car is to figure out exactly what other consumers are paying for it. To do this, you simply need to consult the Kelly Blue Book...For years, the Kelly Blue Book has been the premier index of used vehicle values. Simply enter your car's make, model, mileage and production year into the Blue Book's online search tool and you'll be able to see all you need to see to make a good valuation. The Blue Book lists how much the car is worth in various conditions, how much it sells for in your area and the lowest price a dealer should accept. ..SEE: ..If you want a second opinion, you can also visit Edmund's True Market Value calculator. Much like the Blue Book, the TMV provides you with the average selling price of a vehicle across a range of categories. In this case, you can see what you should expect to pay buying it certified pre-owned from a dealership, buying it non-certified from a dealership and buying it from a private seller. ..Once you've determined how much your car-in-waiting is actually worth, set floor and ceiling offers to bring with you to the negotiating table. The floor offer is your initial offer and should be between 5-10% lower than the vehicle's average selling price. The ceiling offer is the absolute maximum that you're willing to pay to take it home. ..With your floor and ceiling offers ready, it's time to start negotiating. When you walk into a dealership, the sales agent will try a number of techniques to get you to loosen up your purse strings. They'll ask you how much you want to pay per month in order to hide the bottom line price. They'll ask for your maximum spending limit so that they can try to convince you to spend a few hundred dollars more. They'll do everything they can to make you commit to that sticker price...Do not humor them. Don't answer any of their questions, especially the one about the spending limit. Politely tell them that you don't want to discuss financing right now. Show no interest, even if you're in love with the car. ..Instead, ask salesperson to sit down. Present him or her with your floor offer and state that you're willing to take the car off the lot today if he or she can accept that price. Most likely, the salesperson will tell you that that they can't accept that price. That's fine, because they're not supposed to. ..After turning down your floor offer, the sales agent will give you a list of reasons why the dealership deserves more money for the vehicle. Again, don't humor them. Politely explain that you know exactly what the vehicle is worth. Tell him or her that you've been to multiple dealerships over the past few weeks and can find a similar vehicle at all of them. You just happen to prefer this particular vehicle, and as a result are willing to let this dealership have the first shot at your business. If they don't want to play ball, that's fine. You can always take your money elsewhere. At this point, the sales agent will probably go consult his or her manager. After a few minutes, he or she will sit back down ? perhaps accompanied by the manager ? and present you with a counter offer that's slightly lower than the sticker price. The sales team will give you a hard sell on how this is as low as they can go and any lower would be ripping them off. In response, present the dealership with a .. that's a few hundred dollars higher than your floor offer. List all of the flaws you found during your inspection and reiterate that you can always take your business elsewhere...At this point, you and the salesperson will be playing a game of who can wear down whom. The sales agent will keep slightly lowering his or her offer while you keep slightly raising yours until one of two things happens. In one instance, you'll meet in the middle and settle on a price that's roughly equal to the car's average value. If that's the case, then congratulations ? you just purchased a car! In the other instance, you'll hit your ceiling offer...If the dealership flat out refuses to accept your ceiling offer, then get up and walk away. It hurts, but you need to stand strong. Tell the salesperson that they just lost a sale and that you'll be going to the other dealerships to purchase a vehicle there. Ask the manager for his or her card, and write your number down on the back. Tell them that they can always call you if they change their minds. Then casually drive away. After a day or two, it's likely that the seller will call you back. A sale is a sale, after all, and it's better for them to get a car off the lot than it is to deny you the vehicle because you're undercutting the price. If they refuse, then go around to the other sellers in your area and repeat this process. Remember that negotiations are meant to be tedious. As long as you stay strong, you can be sure that you'll get your hands on a new vehicle eventually and at a price that's much fairer than what the dealerships would like you to pay. When you finally have a new set of keys in your pocket, you can move on to the final segment of our Used Vehicle Buying Guide ? financing your ride. ..When buying a used car through a dealer, you'll be forced to work with the dealerships finance and insurance officer to sign all of your paperwork. This person isn't a financial officer at all, but rather a highly trained salesperson who will try to sell you a number of additional services like an extended warranty, paint protection, gap coverage and more. Regardless of what they tell you, you don't need any of the services they offer. In most cases, you'd be wise to turn them down and simply buy the car like you originally intended. Additionally, if your dealer agreed to perform maintenance on the car before you take possession, make sure that this agreement is documented in a Due Bill. ..SEE:

consumer.ftc.gov..A new car is second only to a home as the most expensive purchase many consumers make. According to the .., the average price of a new car sold in the United States is about $30,000. That?s why it?s important to know how to make a smart deal...Think about what car model and options you want and how much you?re willing to spend. Do some research. You?ll be less likely to feel pressured into making a hasty or expensive decision at the showroom and more likely to get a better deal...Consider these suggestions:..Negotiations often have a vocabulary of their own. Here are some terms you may hear when you?re talking price...If you decide to finance your car, be aware that the financing obtained by the dealer, even if the dealer contacts lenders on your behalf, may not be the best deal you can get. Contact lenders directly. Compare the financing they offer you with the financing the dealer offers you. Because offers vary, shop around for the best deal, comparing the annual percentage rate (APR) and the length of the loan. When negotiating to finance a car, be wary of focusing only on the monthly payment. The total amount you will pay depends on the price of the car you negotiate, the APR, and the length of the loan...Sometimes, dealers offer very low financing rates for specific cars or models, but may not be willing to negotiate on the price of these cars. To qualify for the special rates, you may be required to make a large down payment. With these conditions, you may find that it?s sometimes more affordable to pay higher financing charges on a car that is lower in price or to buy a car that requires a smaller down payment...Before you sign a contract to purchase or finance the car, consider the terms of the financing and evaluate whether it is affordable. Before you drive off the lot, be sure to have a copy of the contract that both you and the dealer have signed and be sure that all blanks are filled in...Some dealers and lenders may ask you to buy .. to pay off your loan if you should die or become disabled. Before you buy credit insurance, consider the cost, and whether it?s worthwhile. Check your existing policies to avoid duplicating benefits. Credit insurance is not required by federal law. If your dealer requires you to buy credit insurance for car financing, it must be included in the cost of credit. That is, it must be reflected in the APR. Your .. also may have requirements about credit insurance.

These incentives can grab your                    attention, but they can also obscure the actual terms you're getting on your purchase...How can you fully understand incentives to get the lowest possible price on your car?..Most state franchise laws prohibit manufacturers from selling cars directly to the public, so the                    dealer will be your middleman. But in terms of financing and insurance, you can choose a bank or the                    dealer directly...How can you determine what's in your best interest?..Destination charges, taxes, license and title fees, advertising fees... When going to a dealership,                    you must ask for an explanation of any fee you don't understand. But you need to choose your battles                    wisely. Your local car dealer may have taken a loss or slim profit along the way, and your fighting                    over something like a doc fee when the deal is nearly wrapped up may be counterproductive...In any case, there are many fees and charges in the sale process: some inevitable, others                    questionable...How do you tell them apart?..If you currently own a car, it probably represents profit. The question is, whose profit will it                    be?..With few exceptions, you'll get the most money for your used car by selling it privately. That's because dealers pay wholesale prices ? not retail prices ? for used cars, and they sell them at retail...Your current car's value can be used to lower the price on your new car. However, most people                    underestimate their used car's value when going to a dealership...How can you maximize your value?..The car manufacturer holds back a fraction of the price of all vehicles the dealership sells. Then,                    it returns the money to the dealership, usually on a quarterly basis...Dealer holdback began its life as a safety net that ensured the manufacturers would have a security                    deposit of sorts if a dealership missed payments, and the dealerships would have money on hand to                    cover overhead costs when the holdback was returned...How can you take advantage of dealer holdbacks to get the bottom line price?..Unlike consumer incentives, dealer incentives are factory-to-dealer incentives that reduce the                    dealer's true cost to buy the vehicle from the factory to below invoice.                ..                ..Manufacturers offer these incentives on a regional basis to generate sales on specific models. These                    incentives are sometimes referred to as "spiffs," and they can touch off competition among dealers                    to move slower-selling stock...For instance, a dealer incentive may kick in when a certain sales target is reached, with each                    subsequent sale resulting in a higher factory-to-dealer rebate...How can you benefit from that?..?2016 CarPriceSecrets.com?.

This model is no except...                    ..According to World Bank Database, Pakistan has 57 motor vehicles per 1000 people in the country. Although compared to Western European, East Asian and North American countries, this number is not very high but taken into account the fact that 60% of Pakistani population lives in villages, this number becomes very significant. The country has an extensive network of highways, primary arteries in the city and secondary roads which for the most part have an excellent quality and are well-maintained. In terms of vehicle ownership, major urban population centers like Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad and Rawalpindi are no less motorized than any other major city in any other country. These cities have circular roads as well as expressways and a big percentage of people commute to work and possess a vehicle...Since the independence in 1947, the European (mostly British) and American models were gradually replaced by Japanese brands during the 1960s and 1970s and as of now a vast majority of vehicles in Pakistan is Japanese made, assembled, designed or imported.The most popular motor vehicle brands are Honda. Toyota and Suzuki. The most easily found Toyota vehicles are Corolla and Corona, for Honda they are .. and .. and for Suzuki they are.., ..and ... The most frequently found body type for Toyota and Honda cars is the 4 door sedan while although Suzuki has the sedan body type for Baleno, the most well known body type remain the hatchback...The Suzuki motor vehicle brand is the most ingrained in the Pakistani psyche as well as most well established in the Pakistani automobile market because Suzuki was the first ever brand to be assembled in Pakistan. During the 1980s, in the midst of the Asian Economic Boom, Japan decided to be proactive and counter the US and European carmakers? advances in emerging markets by offering to build assemble plants in Asia and Latin America and so Pak Suzuki Motors started to manufacture FX in Pakistan in 1983...During the early part of the 2000s and during the late 90s a number of new models started becoming available in Pakistan. South Korean automobiles made a foray in the Pakistani market and now .., Kia and Hyundai, the three flagship South Korean brands, are also available in Pakistan. Most Daewoo cars are available in the 4 door sedan body type however Kia and Hyundai are mostly available as hatchbacks...US car manufacturers are also trying to capture their market share lately and the first US brand to come to mind in this regard is Chevrolet (GM). These cars are now assembled in Pakistan and are available both in sedan and hatchback body types...Most of the cars on the Pakistani automobile market are used because not everybody has the budget to put down money for a new car. A huge collection of new, used and reconditioned cars can be found ... Most of the established brands such as .., .., .., .., .., .., .., .., .. etc. have their own dealerships which serve as sales and distribution points. Many imported luxury brands such as Ferrari, .., .. and .. have their own distribution network and sales points in affluent cities such as Lahore, Karachi, Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Sialkot and Faisalabad.

WiseBuyer's Guides - Used car prices
http://www.wisebuyers.co.uk/motoring/used-car-prices/

Choose a manufacturer to check the car's used price.

?..Please choose a manufacturer:..Kia's new SUV scored highly in all four areas (90 percent Adult Occupant Protection, 83 percent Child Occupant Protection, 67 percent Pedestrian Protection and 71 percent Safety Assist) thanks to an even stronger body shell and a wide array of passive and active safety equipment...The Sorento was praised in particular for a passenger compartment that remained stable in the event of a collision, with good protection for passengers of different statures no matter where they were seated in the car. All passengers - including those in the third row of seats - were also well protected from whiplash, while pedestrian impact was aided by the Sorento's active deployable bonnet...The structure of the new Sorento is significantly stronger, thanks in large part to the more widespread use of ultra-high tensile steel. The previous-generation model was made up of 24.4 percent ultra-high tensile steel (UHTS), while the body shell of the new model consists of 52.7 percent UHTS, aiding the integrity of the car's core structure in the event of an impact and also improving torsional rigidity by 14 percent...The new Sorento also features more than twice as much ultra-strong hot-stamped steel as the outgoing model, up from 4.1 percent to 10.1 percent in the new model, greatly strengthening the A- and B-pillars...The high-tech Sorento also achieved a high score in the Safety Assist category. The new model's standard-fit Vehicle Stability Management (VSM) system ensures the car remains stable when simultaneously braking and cornering, particularly on low-grip surfaces, by carefully controlling both the Electronic Stability Control (ESC) and electric motor-driven power steering. Both systems are activated as soon as the car's sensors detect a loss in traction, helping the driver to remain safely in control of the vehicle.

The price of driving: car ownership costs around the world
http://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/before-you-go/the-price-of-driving-car-ownership-costs-around-the-world/

Britons planning a move to Russia or India may be daunted by the prospect of Siberian winters or chaotic traffic in sweltering heat.

ritons planning a move to Russia?or India may be daunted by the prospect of Siberian winters or chaotic traffic in sweltering heat. But new data showing the cost of buying and running a car in the UK compared with 10 other countries, highlights the two for cheap motoring...The survey works out the cost of buying a new or secondhand car plus the first year?s running costs, such as fuel and insurance, so it?s a good guide to how much an expat will need to spend to get mobile...Back home in the UK, these costs total ?18,901, of which ?17,000 is the average price of a new hatchback such as a VW GolfTrendLine 1.4 or its equivalent. On top of that is unleaded fuel at ?1,154 (assuming 6,000 annual mileage at the US average of 24.1 mpg) where the fuel costs ?1.02 per litre. Added to this is an average insurance cost of ?747...Comparable totals for Russia and India are only ?11,605 and ?8,768 ? in Russia the new car costs ?11,195 and in India ?7,813...If a driver?opted for the home produced Lada in Russia the new wheels cost a mere ?2,682. In India, the local Tata Nano costs ?2,057, little more than the price of an old banger in the UK. Russian petrol is about 33p per litre, while the average unleaded price is 65p per litre in India...he USA appears to top the expense table according to the research from Carfinance247, an online car finance broker. However, that is mainly because of the initial car cost in America where a VW hatchback costs the equivalent of ?23,283, about a third more than in the UK...However, air conditioning and automatic transmission tend to be standard in the USA while big cars and SUVs are usually better value than compact cars in comparison to the UK. The fuel is also cheap, at about 30p per litre for unleaded...?? ..In Brazil, a new small hatchback costs ?12,362 while unleaded petrol costs 65p per litre. However, there are hidden costs, according to Brian Hazlehurst, a writer and translator who lives in Rio de Janeiro...?Insurance is very expensive, due to high crime levels in certain areas, while road tolls often cost more than fuel. But they do result in better maintained highways,? he said...South Africa and Australia, popular destinations for expats, are easy on the motorist?s pocket. In South Africa, the new car costs ?10,460, while fuel is about 51p per litre for unleaded. Comparable costs for Australia are ?12,227 and 58p per litre...eanwhile, the UAE?s reputation as a paradise for motorists is borne out by the research. The new hatchback costs ?14,360, while unleaded fuel is a treat at only 30p per litre...Annabel Kantaria, an expat in Dubai, said: ?It cost me ?10 to fill a Land Rover LR4 with super high octane petrol?yesterday thanks to low fuel prices, but this will go up if and when the price of oil rises..."Many Western expats find they have more disposable income here than they might have at home and, with the price of cars and fuel currently lower than in their home countries, are able to buy and run higher performance cars than they might own back home.''..?? ..Driving in Germany and Japan is only slightly cheaper than in UK, judging by the figures. The VW TrendLine costs about ?14,271 in Germany and ?15,636 in Japan while unleaded fuel costs about 97p per litre in Germany and 77p in Japan...he survey does not include Singapore, perhaps the ... Rosie Milne, who lives there, said: ?Before you can run a car you need a certificate of entitlement. You can?t buy any new car for less than ?40,000 and the weekly petrol bill for our Nissan Qashqai is the equivalent of ?55, even though it is mainly used on short journeys, while insurance costs about ?360 and maintenance, servicing and parts another ?550.?..The data was gathered by Mediaworks, a marketing agency, on behalf of .., drawing on 70 different sources including petrol price listings, car sales websites, car buying guides, travel guides and news reports.?The figures exclude taxes and costs in sterling were calculated on exchange rates with local currencies in January 2016...?..?

Where to get the best used car prices
http://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/30/where-to-get-the-best-used-car-prices.html

The price of the same used car can vary widely depending on what city you're shopping in.

  How much does a Honda Accord cost? The answer might depend on where you live. ..  The price of a used car can swing more than 20 percentage points depending on what metro area you're shopping in, according to a study from an online used-car marketplace. The findings show trends in regional economics and potential opportunities for well-planned "carbitrage." ..  That 2013 Accord you were shopping for costs an average of $15,918 in Miami, the nation's cheapest place to buy a used car, according to the data. In Fresno California, the equivalent car would cost $18,297. ..That's according to data from CarGurus.com, provided exclusively to CNBC. CarGurus, a Massachusetts-based online marketplace for used cars, crunched the numbers on more than five million used cars listed for sale in the 98 largest metro areas in the country. ..  The study found that relative to the national average, Miami had the cheapest price for used cars, followed by Cleveland and Akron, Ohio. Many of the least affordable metro areas were in the West: Fresno, Albuquerque, New Mexico and Reno, Nevada are at the bottom of the list. ..  Buying a used car is often a maze of known unknowns with price being one of the biggest factors. Car buyers looking for a 2007 Chevy Tahoe with 130,800 miles in Wichita, Kansas could save an average of $1,200 by driving 160 miles south to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma for example. ..  "While staying local makes sense for most car shoppers, they also may not be aware that car prices do vary across the country," said Lisa Rosenberg, a data analyst at CarGurus. "Expanding a car search to a nearby city can sometimes yield significant savings, and for those truly driven by price, it might be worth it.".. ..  So what's going on here? For one thing, the variation shows regional patterns: Used cars in the Northeast are generally priced below the national average while those in the South and West are above. ..  According to CarGurus' data, there's a weak inverse correlation between car prices and population density. That means buyers sometimes can find better deals in more spread-out cities, which makes sense because the denser the population, the more transportation options there are likely to be. ..  There's a similarly weak inverse correlation between price and total number of listings in a metro area. CarGurus didn't find any correlation with a number of other variables, from number of dealerships in a metro area to the median one-bedroom rent for an area. ..  The price of used cars is generally more volatile and subject to economic conditions than that of new cars. During the most recent recession for example, the relative price of used cars fell around 10 percent, according to consumer price index figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics... .. ..Public Username for Commenting..Data is a real-time snapshot *Data is delayed at least 15 minutes..Global Business and Financial News, Stock Quotes, and Market Data and Analysis..Data also provided by..? 2016 CNBC LLC.

http://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/the-top-ten-most-expensive-cars-in-the-world/

If you?ve recently discovered an oil reserve in your backyard, you probably have some extra cash to spend.

The most expensive cars in the world are so much more than transportation. These rolling art pieces encapsulate the priorities of the one percent, and in that universe, flamboyance and swagger take precedence over practicality and efficiency. Lifestyle criticisms aside, these are truly mind-boggling machines, and we?d like to count down our favorites for you here...For the sake of clarity, we?re categorizing recently made, road-legal production vehicles only ? limited runs notwithstanding ? and we?re leaving out classic cars sold at auction. We?re also limiting the list to one entrant per nameplate, so don?t expect 10 different iterations of the same Bugatti Veyron...So whether your name is Buffet, Gates, Stark, or McDuck, these rides are for you ? the most exorbitant people-carriers on the planet. They say money can?t buy happiness, but after viewing this list, you just might beg to differ...Koenigsegg makes its first?appearance on our list with the CCXR Trevita, and it does so as the most expensive street-legal production car in the world. Why so much coin? With no exaggeration, the car is literally coated in diamonds ? and diamonds aren?t cheap...For the Trevita, the Swedish manufacturer developed a new exterior finish called the Koenigsegg Proprietary Diamond Weave, which involves coating carbon fibers with a diamond dust-impregnated resin. We can?t even fathom how much the touch up paint costs...Underneath the lustrous finish lies a 4.8-liter, dual-supercharged V8 with a total output of 1,004 horsepower and 797 pound-feet of torque, which means it should have little to no trouble overtaking semis on the freeway.? The car?s specifications ? in both performance and price ? are nearly comical at this point, and just three were ever made...Poison. That?s the name Lamborghini chose for the modified .. you see above ? translated from Italian of course ? built to celebrate the automaker?s 50th birthday. We can?t speak for the company?s motivations, but the name is fitting for a vehicle that looks so positively deadly, so undeniably venomous...The car is absolutely stunning from every angle, and to this day, we?re not convinced it isn?t an alien spacecraft surveying our planet for eventual takeover. It just doesn?t seem real. The only thing more remarkable than the look is the price ? a whopping $4.5 million...The Veneno is fast, and that should come as no surprise. Its 6.5-liter V12 spins all the way up to 8,400 rpm to deliver 740 hp and 507 lb-ft, surging the car to 60 mph in 2.9 seconds...You may recall the Lykan Hypersport from its starring role in the blockbuster .., where the Lebanese supercar crashed through not one, not two, but .. skyscrapers in Dubai. In a franchise filled with high-end exotics and one-off custom creations, the fact that the Hypersport got so much focus is a testament to its magnetism...Let?s start with the styling, which includes jewel-encrusted headlights, scissor doors, and an interior ripped straight from science fiction. It looks like a pissed off armored car from the future, and its performance is right on par with its image. The Hypersport boasts a 3.7-liter, twin-turbo flat-six that yields 770 hp and 708 lb-ft...It?s not just Dominic Toretto who benefits from this level of performance though, as the Abu Dhabi police force has drafted the Hypersport into patrol duty. Although it?s mainly used for marketing and public relations purposes, the high-flying stunner assures that the authorities can keep up with any baddie that tries to get cute on the freeway. Pedal to the floor, 0 to 62 mph is accomplished in just 2.8 seconds, and top speed is a downright scary 240 mph...This list wouldn?t be complete without some version of the mighty Bugatti Veyron. We?re shining our spotlight on the the Mansory Vivere edition here, because not only is it one of the fastest cars in the world, it?s one of the most expensive...Augmented by German witch doctors Mansory, the 1,200-hp Veyron starts out as a Grand Sport Vitesse Roadster, only to be adorned with a gorgeous carbon fiber body, a new spoiler package,? ? upgraded LED lights, a rebuffed cabin, and a redesigned front grill. Further classifying the Veyron as a work of art, maps of historic race events like the Targa Florio are laser etched into the exterior and interior. Oh, and it can do 254 mph...With an asking price of $3 million, the Ferrari Sergio isn?t the most expensive car on our list. It is, however, one of the most highly-coveted vehicles in the world, as only six were ever made...Crafted by legendary Italian design house Pininfarina, the Sergio is essentially a Ferrari 458 Spider with a completely new body and interior. That means a 4.5-liter V8 sends a whopping 562 hp to the rear wheels, but because the Sergio is lighter than the 458, it?s quicker and handles better as well. The new body doesn?t just save weight though, it?s chock-full of interesting details like aerodynamic headrests that are built directly into the roll cage...With so few examples built, the Sergio?s purchase process wasn?t as simple as strolling up to a Ferrari dealership. No, each owner was chosen by automaker?itself, making it one of the rare invite-only vehicles in automotive history...With an AMG-sourced V12 and the fastest road-legal?..lap ever, the Pagani?Huayra is a beast through and through ? it?s named after the Incan God of Winds, after all. That wasn?t quite enough for Pagani though, because at the 2016 Geneva Motor Show, Pagani debuted the Huayra BC, a lighter, hotter version?that takes no prisoners...Right off the bat, you can tell the BC is playing a different game from the standard Huayra. It?s fitted with an enormous?active rear spoiler that?generates 1,102 lbs of downforce at 155 mph, as well as a wider rear track, new side skirts, and a bevy of sexy aero goodies. Despite the additions, the BC is a true featherweight, tipping the scales at a paltry?2,654 lbs thanks to the extensive use of carbon fiber and other lightweight materials. The whole deal will cost you a cool?$2.6 million (or it would have, if all 20 units hadn?t been sold already), but you clearly get a lot for your money. With 789 turbocharged ponies on tap, the BC may actually live up to its godly name...To celebrate Ferrari?s 60-year tenure in North America, the Italian brand built 10 examples of this stunning bombshell. Based on the F12 Berlinetta, the F60 is undeniably patriotic as it wears a Stars and Stripes color scheme, American flag seat inserts, and classic racing livery all around. Better yet, you can experience the glory with the top down, as the F60 equips a lightweight fabric top that can be operated at speeds up to 75 mph...The supercar is mechanically identical to the F12, but the Berlinetta isn?t exactly a Fiat Panda to begin with. Its 6.2-liter V12 churns out 740 glorious hp, enough to propel the car to 60 mph in only 3.1 seconds. The ultra-rare flag-waver hearkens back to Ferrari?s bespoke past, as the company built several region-specific sports cars in the 1950s and 1960s...How do you follow up a classic? You make something even better...With a starting price of $2.5 million and a gorgeous new body, the divine Chiron outdoes its predecessor in every conceivable way. While the Bugatti Veyron redefined what an automobile could do, the Chiron laughs?at those who said the Veyron was the last of its kind, pushing the boundaries of performance even further into the stratosphere...The supercar?s?monstrous specs are made possible by its reworked?quad-turbocharged 8.0-liter W16, which now produces 1,500 hp and a monstrous 1,180 lb-ft. 60 mph is dealt with?in a rather quick 2.5 seconds on the way to the Chiron?s top speed, which is?limited to 261 mph. It?s still not the fastest car in the world?? the title belongs the .. ? but cars like these aren?t just about speed; they?re about making statements. We think you?ll agree this Bugatti makes a very strong statement indeed...You can buy a lot with $2 million ? a really nice house, about 80 Mazda MX-5?s, or the Swedish ?megacar? shown above. A logical thinker could probably think of a better way to spend your life savings, but megacars don?t give a damn about logic. Because they?re mega. And after reading what the car is capable of, $2 million might actually be a steal...The limited-edition One:1 is based on the Agera R, and it earned its poetic moniker by employing a 1:1 kilogram-to-horsepower ratio. The figure on each side of the colon? 1,340. That?s right, this car has 1,340 hp, and can theoretically top 273 mph because of it. Simply put, this is one of the fastest automobiles ever made, and with its F1-style honeycomb core, carbon fiber intake manifold, and ventilated ceramic brakes, it?s one of the most advanced as well...Just six examples of the speedy Swede were built, and each one was sold quite quickly. Keep an eye out on Craigslist though, you never know...When we think of hybrid hypercars, we generally fantasize about the ?..? ? aka the McLaren P1, Porsche 918 Spyder, and Ferrari LaFerrari. Somehow, Koenigsegg always gets left out, despite the fact that the Swedish automaker makes a vehicle that outshines its electrified competition in many ways...Powered by a twin-turbo 5.0-liter V8 and a 4.5-kWh battery pack, the $2 million Regera produces an outstanding 1,500 hp in total, a stat made all the more impressive when you consider the car?s low weight of 3,240 lbs. 0 to 60 in 2.8 seconds is impressive to be sure, but the Regera?s 0 to 186 mph sprint is even more mind-blowing ? the feat is accomplished in only 10.9 seconds. By Koenigsegg?s internal estimates, the car will be able to reach its top speed of 248 mph in just 20 seconds or so, which is a triumph over physics as much as it is a bragging right...Why just an estimate? Apparently, the brand can?t find a road long enough.

Electric Cars 2015 List -- Prices, Efficiency, Range, Pics, +
http://evobsession.com/electric-cars-2014-list/

[]

                .. February 16th, 2014 |                ..Wondering what electric cars are on the market or soon will be? Wonder no more. I?m going to run down all of them in the article below. I will also add a few key details and commentary for each one (including prices, efficiency, range, and # of seats when such information is available)...Furthermore, I?m doing something I don?t think I?ve seen anywhere else ? I?m listing all of the electric cars that are available in the US ..?all of the electric cars that are available in Europe. In the case of electric cars only available?in Europe, I?ve tried to find the prices in euros in key markets, in British pounds, and sometimes in other popular markets (like Norway)...The cars are listed from most affordable to most expensive ? ..?the US federal tax credit for EVs. Note that 100% electrics come with higher tax credits, so can end up being cheaper than plug-in hybrids. Also, tax credits are greater for plug-in hybrids with bigger batteries, so even within that category?cars can swap places?after calculating the tax credit. (Also don?t forget that many other countries, US states, and even some cities and regions offer EV incentives of their own, some of which apply to all of the cars below, and some of which only apply to 100% electrics.)..The .. is a cute and fun little two-seater that comes in at a super affordable price. With just two seats, it?s clearly not a ?family car,? but it is a ton of fun to drive and very adequate for most driving needs. Despite (or because of) its small size, the Twizy was the .. and?... It?s really a blast to drive. I?d recommend it. Read my .....The .. is a low-price, simple electric car produced and only available in France. It is used in the?Autolib??carsharing?program in Paris, but is also available to retail customers. It was the?... It?s not going to thrill most people, but it will get you from A to B...The .. (aka Mitsubishi i-MiEV) is one of the most basic electric cars on the market, but also one of the cheapest. As noted below, the?Citr?en C-Zero,?Peugeot iOn, and?Mitsubishi i all have essentially the same design but serve different markets...The .. could be the cheapest electric car on the US market? if you don?t own or lease it for very long. However, due to an $80/month battery rental, the price rises to about the same as a 2014 Mitsubishi i within 3 years (note that the Mitsubishi i seats 4, while the smart electric drive seats two). Within about 6 years, the smart electric drive is about the same price as a 5-seat and much more plush Nissan Leaf. In my personal opinion, the smart electric drive is a hard sell ? unless you really want a tiny car or only want it for 2 to 3 years.?Read .. or the .....If I were on the market for a car, the .. would certainly be in the running. It?s a good-looking, 100%-electric, super-affordable car with great reviews. It?s about the same price in France, its home country, as the Nissan Leaf is in the US, and just a little more than the base Leaf costs in France (?18,090). Basically, the choice comes down to personal preferences...Only behind the Leaf, the Zoe was the ... Despite only being available in Europe, it was the .. ? the highest-ranking car to be available on only one continent. Read .....The .. is a low-priced 100%-electric car that has gotten good reviews (compared to its gasoline cousin, that is) but is only available in a few markets. The Chevy Spark EV was the first car on the market that could use the?SAE Combo Fast Charging system...The ..?is VW?s second electric car, following close behind the VW e-Up! Clearly, it?s an electric version of VW?s extremely popular Golf model. The e-Golf is one of?the closest competitors to the world-leading Nissan LEAF, so it could potentially see very big sales numbers.?However, its significantly higher price is certainly keeping sales down a lot, so VW will have to change that if it actually wants to sell this car...The .. is seemingly the most competitive electric car on the market. It is the world?s best-selling electric car in history. After test driving several EVs myself, I have to say that it would be hard to beat the Nissan Leaf for the?money? unless you have enough?money to dump on a higher-end EV, like the Tesla Model S, Mercedes-Benz B-Class Electric, or BMW i3.?Read .....The ..is Ford?s only 100%-electric car. The car compares in many regards to the top-selling Nissan Leaf, but it also has some disadvantages in terms of cargo space, interior design, and range. The Focus Electric is more broadly available than many compliance cars, but it still isn?t as easy to find as a Nissan LEAF or BMW i3...The .. was either?the?... Unfortunately, its electric range is just 11 miles, then the gas engine kicks in. The Prius PHEV is most likely aided by the strong, high-selling Prius brand. It mainly competes with the Chevy Volt, Ford C-Max Energi, and?Ford Fusion Energi, but it really doesn?t seem to fare well against them these days. Either due to the increasing competition, people simply deciding they want more electric range, or Toyota cutting supply, sales of the Prius Plug-in fell off a lot toward the end of 2014...One of two cars in Ford?s Energi (plug-in hybrid electric vehicle) lineup, the .. has quite good specs for someone who doesn?t drive very far on most days but wants to take very long trips fairly regularly. It?s also good for larger families, as it seats up to 5 people. Despite seating 5, it is cheaper than the Chevy Volt? until you factor in the federal tax credit. The C-Max Energi?is also the most efficient plug-in hybrid electric car on the market. As a result of all of this, the car has sold quite well. Despite only being available in the US, the?C-Max Energi was the .....The .. has gotten great reviews. However, the head of Fiat apparently hates electric cars (..) and is only producing the 500e in ..?(basically, because ..). Hopefully the cute electric car will someday soon be available to a broader market. With its relatively low price, good reviews, and cool styling, it could give some of the top-selling electric cars on the market a run for their market. Read my full?.....The ..?is an affordable, rather simple electric car but also has some unique braking flexibility and is an adequately comfortable and modern car. I prefer the Leaf, but I think plenty of people might prefer the e-Up!? especially if they are VW fans or want more control over their regenerative braking options.?Read .....The ..?is a snazzy electric vehicle with a bit more space on the inside than the average car, and a clear youngster appeal.?The Kia Soul EV has sold okay in the markets where it?s available, but it isn?t broadly available, and its overall sales in the US are pretty sad. You can check out .....Quite similar to the?Ford C-Max Energi but with a few more bells & whistles, the .. has done quite well since its introduction in February 2013. The?Ford Fusion Energi certainly offers some competition to the Chevy Volt, the Toyota Prius Plug-in, and its sister, the C-Max Energi. Importantly, for some people, it is larger than all three of these competitors.?It has a bit less electric range than the Volt, but it has enough seats for five passengers. (It has much more electric range than the Prius, and the same as the C-Max Energi ? both of which seat 5.) And it is quite the looker...The .. is one of the most widely acclaimed electric cars on the market. It is the top-selling electric car in the US to date. In 2013, it was the ... Volt owners are known as Voltheads and were ?..? in the US for two years running? before the Tesla Model S arrived (as per Consumer Reports owner satisfaction surveys). Check out .....The .. is essentially the same as the?Citr?en C-Zero (below) and Mitsubishi i (above). Actually, doing a Google search for the Peugeot iOn?s price in the US, Google shows me the?Mitsubishi i and its price. (Smart, Google is.) With sales a little below its twin, the?Citr?en C-Zero, and the Bollor? Bluecar, the Peugeot iOn was the .....The?.. is produced in France but it was developed in collaboration with Mitsubishi Motors Corporation. Again it is a twin of the Peugeot iOn and Mitsubishi i, basically just with a different brand attached. For whatever reason, I am not a fan of the?Citr?en logo and much prefer the Peugeot iOn. But really, it?s the same damn car!..The Hyundai Sonata Plug-In Hybrid is a fairly large and luxurious plug-in hybrids with moderate electric range. Clearly, it?s a bit higher in price than competing Ford Energi models and the Chevy Volt, but it?s a bit lower in price than the Mercedes B250e and BMW i3. You can see .....The .. is a hot plug-in hybrid electric SUV/crossover that has been selling very well in its home country of Japan and initial European markets. It was initially supposed to make it to the US market in 2013, but due to manufacturing delays, the target is now 2015. Despite just hitting the market in the second half of 2013, the Outlander PHEV was the ... Furthermore, it arrived in Europe at the end of the year, and it .., only behind the Nissan Leaf & Renault Zoe. In 2014, the Outlander PHEV was the ... See .....In the Netherlands, where Outlander PHEVs sells extremely well, prices range from??33,050 ($45,300) to??42,967 ($58,900) before VAT. In Norway, they range from?440,800 kroners ($72,600) to 465,800?kroners ($76,700). In its home country of Japan, the Outlander PHEV starts at?3,397,500 yen ($33,350) and goes up to?4,370,500 yen ($42,900) ? 5 different options are available there. Clearly, there?s a ton of variation in price...The ..?is a sporty plug-in?electric car, that obviously comes with a price hike over VW?s other two offerings.?The Golf GTE can go from 0 to 100 km/h in 4.9?seconds on electricity or 7.6 seconds on gas, and the car has 210 horsepower. The Golf?GTE?s top speed is 222?km/h. The European testing system gives the Golf GTE an average fuel economy of 175 mpg (74 km/l).

This could help me in my research?Thanks!..Isn?t Zoe a ?battery not included? car? What does the battery lease cost?..Zachary, it would be nice to have a table with the same specs for every car on the right for every car, and also the range in km and fuel efficiency in l/100km...Thanks for the effort...Great idea. On my list for the weekend (as well as looking into that Zoe price issue?)..You can get a Zoe for as little as ?13000 before incentives and part exchange in the UK or for as much as ?31000 if you want every option...the ?14k renault zoe (after govt rebate) is without owning the battery, you have to pay ?250/month or something. The car is ?18k (after govt rebate) if you want to own the battery. A 2015 model is launching in a few months time with 8% better range due to they have integrated many components into the electric motor instead of having multiple seperate components. The motor is mostly air cooled instead of liquid cooled too. The car is lighter as a result, i think i read around 20kg or something... .....Zachary, great work!..Is the Tesla Model X for $60,000?

I haven?t driven it yet, but have to say that if I were in the market, I think I?d go for it, the LEAF, or the BMW i3...I did some calculations that might help people who want to save money:..Renault Zoe 2013 battery ? ?153 / mile range..Zoe theoretical 2016 battery ? ?100 / mile range..Nissan Leaf ? ?275 / mile range..Nissan e-NV200 combi ? ?213 / mile range..BMW i3 ? ?333 / mile range..Tesla S 60 used ? ?150 / mile range..Tesla S 85D used ? ?259 / mile range..Hth..Awesome!

I haven?t, but I just included several of them here: ..There are a lot, and so many are regional and small in size. But maybe worth doing?

Just seeing this. Keep us updated. Will do a story or two...I am not seeing any car company willing to work on increasing the range other than Tesla...as soon as Tesla bring on the market an all-electric car that sell for 35K and under everything else will vanish. No way I would buy an i3 (I have an X3) when I could have a Tesla so?..Just so everyone is aware ? if your power station generates electricity by diesel (many US ones do) your miles per gallon of diesel that goes into the powerstation gets you about 30 miles on the road ? less efficient and equal/more greenhouse gas than most modern small cars.

Electric Car Sales Up Despite Low Gasoline Prices - Scientific American

Used electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles are also hot commodities

We use cookies to provide you with a better onsite experience. By continuing to browse the site you are agreeing to our use of cookies in accordance with our .....Used electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles are also hot commodities..PALO ALTO, Calif. -- Jane Koca grinned as she stepped out of a Tesla Model S at a neighbor's ride-and-drive event, where half a dozen models were on display. Her next car, she said, will be a plug-in..."I've been waiting," she said. "Each year, they get better and better."..The rollout of new and second-generation plug-in models that can go longer on a single charge by major automakers has ushered in what some analysts call a second era in electric vehicles. As a response, sales of plug-in cars in recent months have been ticking upward, despite low gas prices. Older models have made their way onto an increasingly flourishing used car market...It remains niche enough, however, that incentives can play an outsized role...For example, the used Toyota Prius plug-in hybrid is selling around twice as fast this year as last year on used car website iSeeCars.com, and twice as fast as the average car. More than half of them are sold in California -- and the state's infamous traffic is part of the reason..."California has stopped giving out stickers for high-occupancy vehicle lane access for single occupants of plug-in vehicles," said Phong Ly, CEO of iSeeCars.com. "Really, the only way to get one is by buying a used plug-in. It could be a factor at play."..The three fastest-selling models across the website from January to May were the Toyota Prius plug-in hybrid, the Nissan Leaf and the Tesla Model S. EVs as a group are getting snatched up 10 days faster than gasoline-powered cars on the website...Alternative fuel cars are also selling in larger numbers and at a lower prices on the website than last year, according to an analysis by the firm...Most American families can't afford a new car, according to a Bankrate Inc. study released last week. The average new car sells for $33,865, according to Kelley Blue Book, and a new plug-in car costs more. But used cars are getting cheaper...So far this year, prices for used EVs dropped 15 percent from the same period last year, and the price of used plug-in hybrids dropped 5 percent, according to iSeeCars.com. By comparison, the price of used gasoline-powered cars dropped 1 percent..."You have a lot of 1-to-3-year-old models coming off lease," Ly said. "The lower prices have hit a sweet spot, and maybe that's why people who are generally reluctant may take a chance in buying."..A used Nissan Leaf, first introduced in 2010, is now selling at an average of $12,533, a drop in more than $2,000 from last year. That's in part because cars coming off leases in Georgia are flooding the market. The state was a top market for EVs because of a $5,000 tax credit until the incentives were ended last summer. Now, the share of used EVs sold in the state has doubled. People as far as Missouri have been snatching up the cheap Georgian Leafs...Sales of new electric cars reached 1 percent of total U.S. new car sales for the first time in June, which environmentalists applauded as a milestone...So far this year, sales of new plug-ins have been near or at record levels every month. High-end models, like the Tesla Model S and X or the BMW i3, have dominated, overtaking the previously popular Leaf and Volt...The total volume of sales remains below expectations. California and nine other states have mandated that zero-emissions vehicles make up 15 percent of sales by 2025...Sales of the plug-in vehicles dipped last year, but Scott Shepard, senior research analyst at Navigant Research, resisted tying that trend entirely to low gas prices..."The people who are going after that technology are going after it because it has a plug, not because it has significant cost savings," he said...Instead, he suggested people were waiting for newer models. For example, General Motors Co. announced the second generation Chevrolet Volt, with an electric-only range of more than 50 miles compared to the previous range of less than 40, early last year. It was first introduced in 2010. Sales of the Leaf, the most popular EV, have stagnated among news of an imminent second-generation car..."Every time we see a new and improved plug-in technology, there's this effect where first generation models tends to decline in anticipation of the next vehicle model," Shepard said. "You don't see that among conventional established markets because there's not a whole lot of improvement."..Shepard projects a record year for plug-in sales in Canada and the United States, driven by the introduction of new models. He expects sales to reach an optimistic 200,000, a 62 percent increase from last year...Sales aren't on track to reach that so far. The introductions of the $30,000, 200-mile-range all-electric Chevrolet Bolt; the Prius Prime plug-in hybrid EV, which doubles the range of its predecessor; and the Mitsubishi Outlander plug-in hybrid EV, an SUV already popular in Europe, later this year could boost midmarket sales, he said. Sales of the Tesla Model X and second-generation Chevrolet Volt will also keep gathering steam, he suggested...Nearly 400,000 people have already put in pre-orders for Tesla's 215-mile-range Model 3, which could sell for less than $30,000. It is expected at the end of 2017...Camille von Kaenel..ClimateWire..4 minutes ago  ?  Larry Greenemeier..6 hours ago  ?  John Horgan..5 hours ago  ?  Jo Marchant and Nature magazine..6 hours ago  ?

Self-driving cars coming to a college campus near you as price of tech drops | Technology | The Guardian
https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/30/self-driving-cars-california-varden-labs

Automated vehicles have long been considered the province for big companies, but now even a few college dropouts can get one on the road

Automated vehicles have long been considered the province for big companies, but now even a few college dropouts can get one on the road.. in Sacramento, California........onsider this scene at a .. state college campus:..A futuristic-looking golf cart rolls towards a student walking with her books. When it gets near, it stops on its own, then Brandon Moak leans out and says, ?Would you like a ride in a self-driving vehicle??..Moak doesn?t work for Google or Tesla or any of the other research labs started by major automakers. Last year, he and some friends dropped out of the University of Waterloo and started Varden Labs, an automated vehicle startup based out of a rented house just north of San Jose. This spring, the company started loaning the vehicle to various college campuses around the state to give undergrads a ride to class. ..It doesn?t go very fast and, therefore, doesn?t have to predict how it will drive very far down the road, unlike Google cars cruising at highway speeds. As it moves down a thoroughfare at California State University Sacramento it stops and starts often and the steering system is constantly adjusting itself. ..But here?s the thing: it didn?t cost a lot to build. And if Varden is able to operate at scale, it?d cost even less. .. have long been considered the province for big organizations. But these days, as some of the key pieces of technology have dropped in price and investor interest has soared, even a few college dropouts can get one on the road. That?s set off an investment frenzy among venture capitalists and major carmakers...In March, General Motors announced a $1bn acquisition of Cruise Automation, a startup that sells self-driving conversion kits to hobbyists for highway cruising. Andreesen Horowitz recently invested in Comma, the small automation company started by George Hotz, a hacker who made his Acura drive itself around the Bay Area. Varden Labs meantime has the backing of Y-Combinator, an influential .. startup incubator...These startups don?t enable vehicles that navigate fully on their own ? they only work in certain situations ? intersection-less freeways and closed campuses. ..But it suggests that as big organizations such as Google and Uber labor on fully autonomous vehicles that can pick people up from the pub or ferry roadtrippers across the country, many consumers may get their first tastes of the auto-future from one of these hot-wired shops. .. This now includes students at Sacramento State. ..On a cool March morning Moak, only 20 himself, sat in what would be the driver?s seat and offered students a ride to class. Reactions ranged from shock to confusion. ..?I have no control over the vehicle right now,? he boasted to one passenger. ..For now, Varden is doing short trials at California universities, where the vehicle will do a campus loop or go back and forth down a main drag. In the future, it envisions leaving the vehicles at schools and office campuses...?It means we have a lot less regulations to deal with,? said Alex Rodrigues. ?It means we?re a lot safer. That allows us to get going a lot faster than your average self-driving company.?..Varden Labs has used limited funds to rent a ranch-style house in the heart of Silicon Valley, the kind twentysomethings often turn into coders? lairs. The focus with Varden, however, is just as much on hardware as software. They use a 3D printer to make some custom vehicle parts and the garage is littered with tools and vehicle parts...This is all possible because the cost of a key piece of technology needed for some self-driving vehicles has fallen dramatically in recent years. If you look at a picture of a Google vehicle, you?ll notice an unsightly black device on top that looks a little like a police siren. So-called lidars function as the all-seeing eye for many self-driving vehicles. They aren?t cameras, but rather sensors that map their surroundings by sending out beams of laser light. ..The model on the original Google car cost $80,000. These days, its maker, Velodyne, offers a version for a tenth of the price. That still puts it outside the price range of hobbyists but within reach for many smaller companies. ..There are of course other challenges in running a self-driving startup distinct from coding a new app. The cars aren?t legal on many roads. The federal government is still working through who is considered the driver. Many auto insurers don?t offer a self-driving package (Varden eventually went with Lloyd?s, known for insuring exotic risks, such as Bruce Springsteen?s voice). ..And of course, there?s the inherent risk of taking your hands off the steering wheel. Varden said they had to steer clear of Facebook?s founding mantra, ?Move fast and break things?...?We?re not allowed to break things,? Rodrigues said. ....or .. to join the discussion...This discussion is closed for comments...We?re doing some maintenance right now. You can still read comments, but please come back later to add your own...Commenting has been disabled for this account (..)

Specialists estimate that the markup for Brazilian carmakers is at least twice what is practiced abroad and this could be the result of poor competition. For each car sold in Brazil, the .. profits 10%, while in the USA the percentage is 3%, according to Sindipe?as, the National Sindicate for Industry of Automotive vehicle parts. .. The small hatchback cars are still the most popular in Brazil due to their relatively low prices. For reference on prices of new cars and the most popular models in Brazil, check the article ?..?. .. According to IHS Automotive Consulting, 32% of the costs of a new car are directly related to ... However, the tax that most concerns car owners is the .. which is due annually. .. IPVA is charged on the ownership of any automobile vehicle. The value is calculated according to the vehicle profile and its state of origin. For the state of S?o Paulo, the rates in 2014 were: .. The rates applied according to the table published by the State Treasury Office, known as .., are based on the average market price for cars of similar models and characteristics. .. A discount is offered if the IPVA is paid in only one installment in January, but it is also possible to pay it in three monthly installments. .., which are those older than 20 years are exempt from the payment of the IPVA. .. In addition to the IPVA, there are other mandatory expenses directly related to owning a car. These are the DPVAT, CNG and Licensing. .. Short for Seguro de Danos Pessoais Causados por Ve?culos Automotores de Via Terrestre this is an insurance for personal damage caused by automobiles, which guarantees that the victims of accidents caused by an automobile receive an indemnification. .. The indemnification goes from BRL 2.700,00 to cover medical expenses to BRL 13 500.00 in case of death or permanent disability. The DPVAT is paid along with IPVA and has a fixed value of BRL 105.65 for cars, BRL 292.01 for motorcycles if paid in one installment, BRL 396.49 for buses and BRL 110.38 for trucks.

Once the car has left the dealership, it suffers devaluation that ranges from 10% to 30% in the first year alone. .. Applying this logic, those who buy a brand new economic car, do not have to worry too much about the devaluation that probably will not surpass 15% in the first year.

If you manage to find a garage in the area that will offer you a fixed parking spot you may have to spend between BRL 350 and 450 per month. .. Parking on the street can be charged as well.

The price is BRL 5 per hour and there is a limit of 2 hours per car in the determined spot. If you fail to fill the .. cards or to display it on the dashboard, a fine will be charged.

Honda's New Self-Driving Car Costs Only $20,000

My #1 Secret To Buy A New Car At The Lowest Price In The USA
http://www.truthin7minutes.com/new-car-price/

This post reveals how to get the car of your dreams at the absolute lowest price ...

 .. .. .. .. ..Word is getting out:..And every day, thousands of my readers come here for my insider secrets of buying a car at the absolute lowest price...Read this article until the end, and I am going to show you how to get more car for less...Read every word, and I promise to show you how to get the car of your dreams at the guaranteed lowest price here in the USA...Here we go:..Believe it or not, I feel bad for car salespeople...At the car dealership, they work all kinds of long hours ? averaging more than 60 hours a week...They work most weekends. And they work some holidays, too...Almost all car salespeople work on 100% straight commission. So if they do not sell any cars, they make no money...If they sell cars without stretching the truth, they risk getting fired...No joke...Fired...Knowing this is important...It is the key to get the best price for your next new car...Because the relationship between ?us? (the buyer) and ?them? (the salesperson) is a HUGE conflict of interest...Of course, we want a fair, low price...Yet, car salespeople get a percentage of the profit. So when they discount our price, we are literally taking money out of their paycheck to pay for their food...This is like combining oil and water ? it never mixes well...Many think a salesperson?s job is to help us make good decisions and find the right car for our needs and wants...But that is exactly opposite of the truth:..A car salesperson?s only job is to use psychological schemes to wear us down...That is it. It is nothing more...They convince us to spend up to 5 hours in their showroom. (Sometimes more.)..And when we are out of energy, we usually make bad decisions...Look? cars are usually the second most expensive thing we buy (behind a home)...We should be energetic and alert when making high-dollar purchases...Bottom line: walking into a new-car dealership through the showroom is the absolute worst way to shop for a new car?..Industry journalists tell us getting a new car at the ?invoice price? is the best deal...And car salespeople reinforce this by saying silly stuff like, ?Yikes, my manager is going to turn white if he gives this car away for so little.?..The car industry knows what motivates us?..We do not want to be embarrassed...Instead, we want to brag to our friends and family that we got a good deal on that shiny new car...But this is an age-old psychological trick on us...Car dealers inflate the sticker price by thousands of dollars. Then they convince us the ?dealer invoice? price is the car dealer?s factory price...This is an insulting joke on us...Yep. I said it...This is a highly-classified, highly-guarded secret...Everyone in the car-selling industry denies this when I reveal it...But they are either naive (or flat out lying)...But I know this is true...And I can prove it...You see, I regularly contact Fleet and Internet Sales Managers on behalf of my .....And I asked them to bid on new cars...These bidders willingly discount their prices thousands of dollars below the ?invoice price.?..Trust me when I say car dealers HATE losing money...And they are still making tens of thousands of dollars on each car we buy...The invoice price is NOT what dealers pay for the cars they sell us...Honestly, car dealers should make healthy profits on each car sold...If they do not, everyone loses ? employees lose their jobs and we cannot buy the car we want and desire...But paying ?dealer invoice? is obscene price gouging...It is kind of like paying $15.00 for a 25-cent bottled water at a baseball game...Knowledge is power...And leveraging the secrets they do not want us to know ALWAYS gets us the best price on a new car...Here is how I get the absolute lowest price on a popular, new car?..This even includes the best interest rate on financing?..It even includes the absolute lowest price for extended warranties?..It even gets us the lowest price on GAP coverage insurance?..Instead, start off contacting the Fleet Manager or Internet Manager...Call and ask for their email address...The more you contact, the more enter into your bidding war...I would contact everyone within 100 miles of you...Then send an email requesting their lowest price on your next car...Tell them you are going to buy this week...And do not say you are going to pay cash ? they HATE this. (They make lots of profits financing a car.)..Make sure to send your request for proposals 2 hours after lunch on a Tuesday ? I find this is the best time and day of the week...If you have read this far, you are obviously pretty smart...And I am guessing you are close to buying a new car...You can contact a few local dealers and get a good, low price on your next new car...Getting car dealers to engage in bidding wars works, but it requires a lot of work...Many ignore bidding requests and instead reply with,?Why don?t you just come into the dealership and work something out.?..Only a tiny minority of my requests come back with super low prices...I took these low prices and recontacted these new-car dealers. And I asked them to ?sharpen their pencil? and dig deeper for even lower prices...There is a better and faster way to get the absolute best prices on your next new car?..Without the hassles...Without haggling...And without stress...This is the savviest way?..I recommend hiring a car buying service ? .. (and save thousands and thousands of dollars on a new car at the same time)...Family man. Truth seeker. Traveler... more about me ......?.. | ..?

PAL-V's flying car coming in 2016 for a small price of $395k
http://www.geektime.com/2014/07/10/pal-vs-flying-car-coming-in-2016-for-a-small-price-of-395k/

The PAL-V One is now in development. The flying car can drive on roads and has a very short runway requirement so its easy to take off to avoid traffic or fly

Credit: PAL-V..The PAL-V One is now in development. The flying car can drive on roads and has a very short runway requirement so its easy to take off to avoid traffic or fly over lakes..Credit: PAL-V..If Chitty Chitty Bang Bang were being invented today, it may look something like PAL-V?s new flying car instead of the vintage car from the early 1900s. Unlike Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, PAL-V?s PAL-V One isn?t also a boat, but it does have a sleek look and agility that the old magical car lacked... recently designed a flying car that is road friendly, has a short take-off range and can fly up to 4,000 feet (1,200 meters). .., the Pal-V One is now in production and can be purchased for $395,000. The report said the first cars will be delivered in 2016...The vehicle is a two seat hybrid car and gyroplane with three wheels, giving it agility on the road. Its single rotor and propeller fold up and can be unfolded when ready to fly. The PAL-V One needs a runway of 540 feet (165 meters) for take off and can take off from gravel or grass. It flies lower than commercial vehicles in airspace available for uncontrolled Visual Flight Rules traffic and can reach speeds of 112 mph (180 km/h) on both land and in the air. Because of its low flight range, it is not using controlled airspace, so drivers can take off without flight plans. It also runs on gasoline and is much quieter than helicopters...Credit: PAL-V..?For more than a century man has dreamed of the freedom provided by a flying car,? Pal-V wrote on its website. ?The ultimate vehicle to go wherever and whenever you want to, easily overcoming all sorts of barriers. Now you can leave home and fly-drive to almost any destination! Avoid traffic jams and cross lakes, fjords, rivers or mountain ranges like an eagle. Land on the other side and drive in your own vehicle to your final destination.?..Based in Raamsdonksveer in the Netherlands, PAL-V was founded in 2001 to design a roadable aircraft. Through working with research institutes and universities, it developed Dynamic Vehicle Control tilting technology in 2005, which automatically adjusts tilt angles to speed and acceleration, which enables plane-like tilting when turning a corner. The patented DVC technology allowed PAL-V to make a ?flying car? rather than a roadable aircraft, making the vehicle optimized for both modes of transportation. The company then hired engineers who came up with a proof of concept in 2008 and the first flight of the prototype was in 2012...Since then, the company has been working on development and engineering of the first commercial version...Drivers of the vehicle need a Sports Pilot License in the US or a Recreational or Private Pilot License in Europe. Learning to fly the vehicle takes about 20 to 40 hours of lessons and a theoretical exam. Learning to drive it is much easier, and usually just takes 30 minutes and a private driver?s license...Maybe a little expensive right now, but a flying car would be nice to avoid traffic in the city. That is, of course, if there are convenient places to take off and land...

Used Car Price Plunge "Could Bring The Whole House Of Cards Down" | Zero Hedge
http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-04-11/used-car-price-plunge-could-bring-whole-house-cards-down

When we first warned that something was breaking in the American auto market, the Phil-LeBeau-ians crawled out of the woodwork to explain how everything is still awesome (brushing the weakness in stocks) despite soaring inventories and shrinking credit. Then when used-car prices began to leak lower, a few paid attention and the recent weakness in new car sales has shocked most. Now, however, used-car-prices are plunging at a similar pace to 2008 and RBC wonders if declining used vehicle prices (biggest YoY since 2013) is the card that brings the whole house down.

The world is being prepared for a great fall,..The Fed might be able to put off hiking rates for a time, but eventually this will become a REAL issue. Particularly since CPI cleared 2% when Oil and most commodities were 40% off their highs...?..#Deplorable..When .., the Phil-LeBeau-ians crawled out of the woodwork to explain how everything is still awesome (brushing the weakness in stocks) despite...

(pre-Cash-for-Clunkers).....?..And this price and sales weakness is occurring amid a ..?..None of this should be a surprise to readers, as we noted previously, ..Behnke pointed out that car production has increased a whopping 100 percent since 2009, but that apologists for government?s monetary stimulus programs see this fact as proof of the success of their Keynesian, aggregate demand hypothesis...?..Behnke, on the other hand, took the Austrian perspective that the government has simply substituted a bubble in subprime auto loans for the bubble in subprime home loans. As defaults rise and automobile loan credit tightens, the result will be the same. Namely, a flood of used cars, and falling prices. The same happened with homes following the burst of the last bubble: a flood of ?used? houses, and falling prices...?..Surprisingly,.. Another suggestion was that large dealers will dominate the used car market and simply raise prices at will...?.. More complex and difficult-to-fix cars will not keep prices from falling in an environment in which the inventory of used cars is increasing...?..?..There is one thing that we can know a priori: that an increase in the supply of some good or a drop in its demand will cause its price to be lower ... ..?..Mises explained that, eventually, even a monopolist would prefer any price to zero price. Maintaining a price above the market clearing price produces zero revenue. In a flooded used-car market, car dealers must reduce their prices in order to avoid bankruptcy. .. The laws of supply and demand have not been rescinded, even in a world with very expensive-to-build and complex cars. As the automobile bubble bursts, quality used cars will flood the market, creating a buying opportunity for those with cash...Folks, America is not gonna get better. This is why  >>> ..I don't know what you are peddling, but go sell it someplace else.  You don't belong here...ahhhhhhhhhh.....yes ...........it's da JOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO's........da jOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO's are running the whole planet from tiny jOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOland while it's?? surrounded by it's enemies ..........black ganster in chicago kills muzzie storeclerk ........it's da jOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO's fault......lol lol ...............do yourself a? favor ..........bounce up outa here my man..Read it...Read it...Read it...Lower used car prices, means more people can afford to buy cars and spend money on other things like gas and be more economically productive...Deflation is good!..We should be so lucky. Prices need to come down, the $500 car of two years ago is now $2000, and in no better condition...That's right. We had Cash for Clunkers. Now we got Arm & Leg for Clunkers...In cash for clunkers the gov. took perfectly running cars and destroyed the engines. They used our taxes to destroy good cars, to prop up the banksters and Government Motors. Now, it's been 7 years and the same banksters won't loan against such old cars. Another leg down...Excellent. My old clunker is nearly EOL. Time to take advantage of somebody who had more money than sense. (or no money and no sense in this case)...I'm driving my 03 z71 for a while. Why not? It still looks and runs great. Spent the weekend cleaning it, bet my paint is smoother than just about any new car. Unless the vehicle doesn't fit your needs anymore, there really isn't much reason to replace it. I've got 175k on it, and if the trans goes out, 2k gets me a new one. Less than 6 months of payments on a newer vehicle. I can afford to drive something newer if I wanted, but I am not trying to impress anyone. Already have a good woman and care nothing about impressing the neighbors. ..As the other poster said, starve the beast. ..I'm hooked on my 01 4Runner .... Cool dude who inspected it tried to buy it off me this year. Has 129,000..Yea the gov has a way of destroying industries and civilizations w their how u say it everyine do this every ine do thst shit stuff.... Amazing the industires etc obliterated along the way.  Fadsters dumpsters bs mommy dearest fuck me over bad bs knows best the kiss of death on a road paved with those who know their good intentions only paved a road to hell!..So my 14 year old Porsche Boxster S has no value?..Top down and 70 degrees ... yeah, sure...just remember to fix the ims bearing...LOL can you change your own oil in that thing??? ;-)..?..Psychopaths ?at VW did it... ..  .. ..I am driving an 11 old Aussie Falcon Station Wagon with 100 K kms, when bought at 30% of a new ones price. Runs like new and one can expect 100K+ more of care free kms. Buy a new one and the moment for the first time to turn the ignition key, 20% of the value is going to be lost . Keeping up with appearances is a costly game and drains people, who are lured to to show up...'91 toyota corrolla, about 350,000 miles rebuilt the motor one time, drive it everyday. It just won't die, I will keep it running until it rust to nothing, I actually like driving it. In heavy traffic I just change lanes as I please, the tools driving their brand new cars and still making payments get out of the way real fast. I gave up the "keeping up with the Jones's" a long time ago, best thing I ever did. fuck'em...Same situation as you. 2002 z71 Tahoe 180,000. Another plus is our local mechanic can work on it while the ones have to be serviced at dealer. We paid around 30,000 for it new. New z71 4wd now is in neighborhood of 60- 70,000 I think...I always buy used.....25 years or older. Avoid all the government bullshit! Start a new trend! Starve the beast!..?..And pay cash...Average difference between "trade in" and "retail" price of used cars is $2,000--#3,000 . ?If you see dealers parking lot is filled, offer $ 3,000 less in Cash ? .Dealer needs space for new car inventory, lease returns this Spring and new trade ins. ?He also needs cash to finance new car inventory. ?Last month purchased two cars at deep discounts for 2014 models with low mileage. ?Do the math and save big time..they hate it when I pay cash .... that's why I love it and the freedom of no payments.... saved $33k on a perfectly good top of the line used jeep.?? I'll probably put more miles on it than the person who bought it new with the few fixes needed evey now and then...Being a car guy with a penchant for old muscle cars, I went a step further with my "Mad Max" car. ?Carburetor, points-style ignition (you know, for after the EMP blast fries all the electronics), no computer, no EFI, no "black boxes", no OnStar. ?And yeah, it's got a blower on it. ?Wouldn't be a Mad Max car without one...So in the post-apocalyptic shit goes down I'll still have running wheels, a shot gun, my dingo and a couple cases of Dinki-Di dog food to eat. ?I'll just need to scavenge for the juice. ?The precious juice...I have a mule, four chickens and two goats. I will give you their juice...Today I saw a guy harrowing the shit lumps in the pasture with a four mule team...?..Mule On..If i steal a tesla, how much will the homies get at tue scrap yard?

 ? The Truth About Used Car Prices
http://finance.youngmoney.com/wheels/auto_shopping/040110_01/

[]

..................Before you buy a used car from a car dealer, you should understand a little about pricing. A franchise dealer with a used car operation will usually price his cars at a certain percentage more thanwhat the car is deemed to be worth on the wholesale market...The wholesale value of a car is usually determined by factors such as the demand for the car coupled with the age, make, model, options, mileage and general condition. The dealer?s markup on a used car, van or pickup is frequently determined by any or all of several factors...The markup will also reflect such things as the condition of the car, the mileage, the make, model, options and most important, the market demand. The point, simply, is that used car markups will vary greatly for any number of factors. Your objective is to discover what has it cost him to buy and recondition the car and put it on his lot. That will give you the basis for planning your negotiation...Many dealers will also include a ?negotiation pad? in their markups. They recognize that most people won?t buy a car ? new or used ? unless they feel they?re buying it for less than the advertised price. So a dealer will build in a large enough cushion to give the buyer a discount and still end up with whatever he considers to be a reasonable, or maybe even a more than reasonable, profit...The key to a dealer?s survival and profitability in the used car business is to buy used cars at or below what the industry calls the ?wholesale price? and then to sell them at a retail price that, in the final analysis, is whatever a buyer will pay. Here is an actual example:..I tracked a GM car that was purchased by a dealer for $9,500. After spending $400 for repairs and reconditioning, he put it on the lot at $13,800. That?s a markup over his purchase cost of more than 45 percent!..The used car sales manager confided that this markup gave him .. for negotiation. A buyer finally appeared, and after a negotiated agreement, bought the car for $12,450. The customer felt he?d gotten a deal and the seller said nothing to disabuse him of that notion...Whether you buy from a private owner or a dealer, one of the most important pieces of information you can have is the current ?wholesale? price of the car in your area of the country. One source of auto price information is the car loan department of your bank. They will usually have all the latest price books and possibly even auction reports that show what various makes are bringing on the auction market...The industry uses any of several books as price guides: The ?NADA Official Used Car Guide,? ?National Auto Research Black Book,? ?Kelley Blue Book Auto Market Report? and ?Galves Auto Price List.? These books ? also available online ? purport to reflect the average wholesale prices that various cars are bringing across the country. The only problem is that they usually don?t agree on a set price...Compare the suggested wholesale prices for a 2000 Chevrolet four-door Lumina from the same month:..You can find used car price books on your newsstand or on various Internet sites, e.g., ..Pingback: ..Mike Sullivan, it?s funny that an individual from a lending institution is commenting on dirty tricks.  The amount of markup varies on what the current market conditions are for that exact vehicle and what a dealer paid for it.  For example, dealers typically put more money into local trade ins than they do for cars they buy at auction in order to keep the local business.  So say a dealer has 5 similar Ford F150?s in stock. Each of those trucks is owned for a different amount, even if they have the same Retail Value.  So the markup in one truck could be $3500 and the other truck could be $1900 due to the fact that they own the one for more money.  Dealerships are not non profit companies, they need to show a profit and have every right to do that.  The percentage of markup is far less than what it is in most other retail markets.  The average used car profit for most dealers is probably $1000-$2500 per vehicle sold. And then from that the dealership probably is paying commission to their staff and the manager and sales person has to get paid from that amount...As long as the car is being sold under a retail amount and is a good deal compared to what else is on the market and available for purchase at that time, then it is up to the buyer if they feel that is a good deal. If you can find the same car for less money, then buy the car that is less expensive. A consumer will never know the amount of markup in a used car sold and individuals outside of the dealership will not know. If a car has been at a lot for a few months then the dealership will have to move the car very soon or have to pay interest on the car and that goes to the bank that inventories the inventory. Just like what good ol Mike Sullivan did from the earlier post. So when a car has been there for a while a dealership will generally lower the price to cost or close to it in order to sell it before the dealer has to sell it to an auction and take a good sized loss.  Many dealers will share this info with you if you ask.  Assume that a dealer pays someone $10000 for the trade in, the general expense before it hits the lot is closer to $1000 on the average these days and that does not cover any major expense like tires for example and that is a pretty common item to replace. SO say a dealer has $1500 added to the car they are now at $11500 and Retail would probably be around $13900 for a car like that so that is what they will list it at and leave room to negotiate. So say they sell it for $13000. That will leave them with a $1500 profit to then pay 20%-35% of that amount to the sales rep and then still pay the manager as well if there is one involved.  Most dealers will have a DOC fee which will be $100 to $300. I am guessing that is what Mike Sullivan is speaking of.  That is common and pays for much of the paperwork processing involved and the staff that handles it.  The state and county paperwork is fairly extensive in most area?s and that is what this is generally for.  Feel free to ask the dealer you are by the car from if you have questions. It is clearly disclosed and documented on the legal forms signed to buy a car. It is similar to the fees when you get a mortgage from a lending institution like Mike Sullivan?s listed above...

Toyota?s New Hydrogen-Powered Car Asks a High Price for Mediocrity | WIRED
https://www.wired.com/2014/09/toyotas-new-hydrogen-powered-car-asks-high-price-mediocrity/

The FCV has an edgy look, but it?s missing the performance to back it up and get people really excited about hydrogen.

The iPhone 7's screen is amazing, despite dated tech .. ..........................................................Toyota?s on the verge of finally bringing a hydrogen-powered car to market. The problem is that it promises a boring, if innovative, driving experience, for the price middle-aged men pay to have their toupees blown off. ..Next year, Toyota will start selling the unimaginatively named FCV (to be fair, Honda had dibs on FCEV). The car will be able to drive 300 miles on nothing but hydrogen, with only water vapor as a byproduct. ..Hybrids and battery-powered electrics are hogging all the attention when it comes to alternatives to internal-combustion engines, but the German and Japanese automakers, especially Honda and Toyota, haven?t backed off the idea that the best route to a fossil fuel-free future is using fuel cells to combine hydrogen and oxygen to generate electricity, inside the car. Fuel-cell cars offer the range of a gas-powered car, and their tanks can be filled with compressed hydrogen in just a few minutes. No range anxiety, no waiting hours for your EV?s battery to charge. ..FCEVs have plenty of shortcomings. Hydrogen fuel is available at only a handful of gas stations in the U.S., and the infrastructure for transporting it around the country hasn?t really been developed. The production of hydrogen can itself yield greenhouse gases, if it?s generated from natural gas. The cars are frightfully expensive and the fuel is no cheaper than gasoline. ..But Toyota?s serious about the technology. It has spent 20 years on this program and made a lot of progress. From one generation of test vehicles to the current platform, it cut costs by 95 percent, reduced the size of the fuel cell, and developed tanks made of carbon fiber that improve capacity and can be designed to fit any car body. To make filling up the hydrogen tanks practical, Toyota?s part of a state-funded, $200 million effort to build a network of fueling stations around the Bay Area and Los Angeles, with a few in between. That will help build out the infrastructure and encourage people to buy the cars. It doesn?t do anything for the cost of the fuel itself, which by Toyota?s estimates is as expensive as gasoline. ..Last week, I met up with Jared Farnsworth, an engineer with Toyota?s advanced power train group, to gawk at the FCV and drive the test ?mule,? the camouflaged Lexus HS that?s been fitted with a system very similar to the one that will be in the production car. Under the hood is a fuel cell roughly the size of a suitcase, pulling hydrogen from two tanks each a bit bigger than what you take scuba diving. Total power output is roughly 100 kilowatts. ..I drove the mule for just about 15 minutes around downtown San Francisco, hardly enough to form a detailed judgement, but came away with one impression: This thing, .., is completely unremarkable. The torque is a bit better than your standard internal combustion engine car. There?s no noise, which is nice. I didn?t get the chance to floor it, but the lackluster 0 to 60 mph time of under 10 seconds promised by Toyota sounds about right. All in all, it drives like an underpowered electric car. ..Toyota hasn?t released U.S. pricing for the FCV, but it will charge Japanese customers $69,000. A few years ago, it said it was .., which is still a lot of money for a car that won?t save you any money on fuel, can only be filled at select stations in California, and is barely more fun to drive than a Camry?whether or not you?re helping the planet breathe. ..?There?s no doubt, that the success of this technology will depend less on the genius of the car, than on the ownership experience,? says Bob Carter, a Toyota senior vice president. ?Cost in one thing, but convenience is another.? It?s a fair point, but the high price would hardly be an issue if the drive experience were more fulfilling. Tesla customers can justify the $71,070 base price and reduced range of the Model S because the battery-powered sedan is not only elegant, .. you can buy today. The most powerful version goes from 0 to 60 mph in 4.2 seconds with enough torque to imitate the space shuttle taking off. ..The Toyota FCV has an edgy look to grab attention, especially for a four-door midsize sedan. Toyota?s design philosophy of ?air into water? results in nice lines from the front to the rear. (Toyota isn?t showing off the interior just yet.) But the car is missing the performance to back up the fresh look and get people really excited about hydrogen...Toyota may be right to say fuel cell cars have a place alongside their hybrid and battery-powered brethren in the roster of future technologies. The best way to prove it?or at least to get the public really interested in the idea?is to give us a hydrogen-powered car that really excites. ..Fortunately, Farnsworth says cranking up the power of an FCEV would mostly be a question of increasing the number of plates in the fuel cell stack, which presumably comes with a few extra engineering challenges. Toyota?s already working with Hino Motors to make fuel cell-powered commercial vehicles, which require bigger power plants. Even better, it?s got an agreement with BMW to jointly develop a fuel cell system by 2020. BMW is very good at making cars that don?t suck (or bore), so we?ve got high hopes...The iPhone 7's screen is amazing, despite dated tech .. ..The iPhone 7's screen is amazing, despite dated tech .. ..Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our ..

Negotiating Price:  How Much Will a Car Dealer Come Down? | AxleAddict
https://axleaddict.com/auto-sales/How-much-will-a-car-dealer-come-down-or-negotiate-on-price

If you know what you're doing, and you can keep your cool, a car or truck dealer will come down quite a bit on the price of the vehicle. Terms, strategies, and things you didn't know.

Nowadays, when it comes time to buy a vehicle, we really do have a lot working in our favor, and a lot of resources at our disposal. There are multiple websites we can use to browse prices, deals, factory rebates, regional discounts?the whole gamut. When buying a vehicle, most consumers can be pretty well informed. But can they deal? Can .. wheel and deal with a pro?..Even armed with the Kelly Blue Book values and the Edmunds "True Market Value," and having looked at a million deals online and in the classifieds, when it comes down to it, and you're sitting face to face with a professional car salesperson who haggles every single day, multiple times a day?do you have the gall to haggle with him?..When he says "I'm sorry, but that's what the car's worth," do you have what it takes to say, ?You?re wrong?? I'm inclined to think that many do not...You will inevitably wonder: What is a good price for this vehicle? What is a reasonable offer?..Suppose the vehicle?s MSRP?manufacturer?s suggested retail price?is $35,000, and I offer $25,000, what might happen? Are they going to laugh in my face, take away the beverage they graciously offered me, and have security escort me from the dealership?..Probably not. They probably won't offer you a $10,000 discount either, but they probably won't kick you off the lot...It shouldn't. And, no, it's not...Purchasing a new vehicle is not just a big expense, but an investment, and it is definitely a negotiable endeavor...Certain purchases are non-negotiable. Like when you walk into Walmart, you can?t walk up to the guy and say, "Hey, I know that TV has a $2,000 price tag, but I'll give you $1,500 for it." They will simply say ?No.? and let you walk. Same thing at the supermarket, and so on. They know someone will be along in the next minute paying the posted price...But when you're spending tens of thousands of dollars on something, you better believe you should be negotiating, and they DO NOT want to let you walk...Many people think his goal is to sell vehicles. ..Selling vehicles is a given at a car or truck dealership. The salesperson wants more than that..., while also satisfying the customer. This might seem like a subtle point, but the distinction is important...Conversely, what is the purpose of the buyer? What is his goal? Is it to acquire a new vehicle? No. That's a given. ..... Remember that. Don't be bitter, or feel disenfranchised, or get upset that the dealership is going to make money off your purchase, and that the salesman is going to benefit from your sale. Be happy, because it?s quite possible that you can get a good deal, and at the same time the dealership can make money, and the salesman can make a living. There can be a real balance here....  Excessive profit takes equity away from the buyer. No matter what, you want to avoid negative equity as much as possible...I'm sure many of you have heard, or will hear, from a salesman, that your new vehicle is "an investment". They will use that word ?investment? as a way to persuade you to purchase certain upsells, like warranties, roadside assistance packages, leather seats, accessories, insurance, and all sorts of other stuff. And a new vehicle can absolutely be an investment, for several reasons, but it?s a low-quality investment if you pay too much for it:  if you get taken on the purchase price, gutted on your trade-in, and wheeled all the way into the driver's seat by paying MSRP for a new vehicle and accepting the KBB value for your trade.  Read on...MSRP is an acronym that stands for ... This number is decided by the manufacturer?.. the dealer...The MSRP serves as a starting price for negotiations. Sometimes the dealer will post an "Invoice" price for the vehicle underneath the MSRP and use this as a selling point...An exchange like the following is common ....."Look at the invoice price," says Frank, of Bayside Toyota. "We're only making a few hundred dollars selling you this car at this price, and plus, you're getting almost one thousand dollars off MSRP.".."Oh," says Sally, as she fondles her hair nervously. "That's not too bad. I guess you can't really do much better than that, right?"..Frank smiles, thinking to himself, .."Exactly. You know you're getting a good deal, and we've got to make a little something on the vehicle ..."..What Sally doesn't know is that Bayside Toyota gets a $2,000 rebate from the manufacturer every time they sell a vehicle like this. Plus, the Southeast Division of Toyota Dealerships rewards Bayside Toyota with another $3,000 of dealer cash incentive each time they sell a vehicle like this. Plus, this sale puts Bayside one vehicle closer to their corporate-mandated quota and dealer bonus check. Plus, they charge a $599.99 dealer fee (or something similar) on top of that...Even at invoice price, the dealership might have anywhere between $2,000 and $4,000 dollars of profit to work with on a new vehicle. So imagine their margin at MSRP...You need strategies, because they have lots of strategies for how to sell to you. Some salesmen are highly trained salesmen, others are natural salesmen, and others are just going through the motions to feed their kids, but in general, salespeople have experience, knowledge, and a LOT of tricks of the trade...What do you have? It better be more than jeans, a t-shirt, and some crumpled notes stuffed in your front pocket!..Here?s your plan:..This seems like an obvious one, but whatever you do, DO NOT show up at the dealer without having firmly decided, yourself, "what your monthly payment could be.? This is a bear trap, and you will lose your leg...Deal with your own bank or credit union when it comes to financing. DO NOT go through the dealer. They use the terms of the loan as a bargaining trick, a price slider to confuse you, and in many cases they will mark up the interest rate they get from the lender...Show up at the dealership with a Pre-Authorized Draft (a blank check from your bank, basically) and know that you are in charge...Why are you in charge? Because you have the money...I can just hear it now ... ?But they have the car I want!? No. They have a car, a car that you want, and that they really want to sell you...They will play psychological games with you. They're sizing you up, trying to figure you out, and trying to get you emotional about your purchase. Stay cooperative and down-to-earth. Let them know your intentions, and be honest about some facts. Tell them your name, and what you're looking for, and answer any general questions they might have...Be ready with a pad of paper, and the whole time you?re in that cubicle working that deal, write down the numbers they tell you. You need to know the current figure of every number any time anything changes. That?s so they cannot inflate your trade allowance, and stuff it into the MSRP or the purchase price. Here are the typical numbers you need to be tracking:..There are a lot of dealers, and that black, sleek, leather-trimmed V8 out there, with the word "Limited" badged on the back in chrome, is probably one out of 1,000 vehicles EXACTLY like it, that can be bought or sold at many other dealerships, besides the one that you're at. .. If the deal is not going well ... walk out. .....You just got back from the test drive. It was incredible. You could feel the engine rumbling in your belly. Just the fragrance of the barely-worn leather upholstery intoxicates you with anticipation...The salesman looks at you. "So what do you think?".. You say, "It drives nice. I like this little feature, and this little feature, but I saw the sticker price. We're not really at my number yet.".. This is when the "what-if's" start. The dealer looks at you. "Well, what if I can take $1,500 off that price? Would that help?".. "That's a start. I brought some notes, let's take a look at some figures."..Their first offer is just that. Their second offer is just that. It's the third offer, the fourth offer, and the stop-you-from-walking-out-the-door offer that you're trying to get to...Use options to your advantage. They will try and get closer to your number by offering you less of a vehicle in some way, and unless your number is ridiculous, this is not an acceptable solution. You?ll say,"Well, I like this number we?re at, but this model doesn't have this and that, and your offer on my trade is a little low.".. Get what you want for your trade, but don't be unreasonable. Since you?ve researched all three Kelly Blue Book values for your trade, you have a good idea what it?s worth...Then he'll start throwing the what-if's out there again. What if I can throw in the DVD player, and the fancy tires, what if I give you X amount more for your trade. Would we have a deal then?..Don't say yes. Say, "We'd be closer."..He's going to ask "What is it going to take to earn your business today?" and at this point, after a few offers, a few demands, and a few counter-offers, you probably know what it would take to get you to pull the trigger?so tell him. Make him work for it..."OK. I did it," says the salesman as he comes back from his brief meeting with the Manager. "We can throw in this bell, and that whistle, get it in that color, and give you this for your trade-in, but only if we have a commitment from you, right now."..Now you're almost at the end of the deal. You both know you're a couple turns of the screw away from a deal, and that's when you drop the competition bomb. "Well, I like where we're at here. I like the vehicle. This is a pretty good offer, I've made my notes? (and meanwhile you are actually doing that), ?but like I said before, I'm working with a couple other dealers and this was my first stop on the list. So I need to at least see what they have to offer.".. He suspects the other dealers are going to offer the same thing, but go that tiny bit further to make their deal better. So he's going to go that one step further himself, and sweeten the deal to keep you from walking. He's going to get up and leave again, and come back with a slightly better deal. This is the "closer.? This is as far as they will go, most likely. They will ask for a commitment...If you like this last figure, then say, "Go back to your manager. Get a commitment from him, on this number (circle the number), with this trade figure, and these options, and if he says 'yes' we have a deal." This last request is insurance...He'll come back with the deal you want...When I started out on my own quest for a new vehicle, I not only researched the vehicle, but the salesmen, the dealerships, and the negotiating process?just like you're doing now. Research is worthwhile. It helped me seal an excellent deal...I hope this review helps! It only scratches the surface of the techniques, strategies, and scenarios that could arise But I know I asked myself a lot of these questions, and the big one was "How much can I really get a dealer to come off his asking price without losing credibility and sounding stupid?"..The answer? See above : )..Be peaceful on your way,..I NEGOTIATED A GREAT PRICE WITH DEALER,  ORGINALLY $22.000 PLUS A CASH ALLOWANCE OF $1,000 , THIS BROUGHT THE CAR DOWN TO $21,000 , i thought GREAT NEWS, however during the write up of contract he  added that cash allowance  to the negotiated bringing the price up to 23,000 ,then taxes and fees , then he deducted the cash allowance of 1,ooo. {this doesnt seem right or is it}. Salesman stated cash allowance is taxable...hmmm ..Is this correct or im being scammmed.  Its seems like im not really getting a true cash allowance. please help , because this is not making sense to me.  what do u think? Is this correct practice.?..Very good article! Shopping for a new vehicle can be a daunting task. Looking to purchase a 2017 Ford Explorer XLT and I can honestly say I've had a few laughs and many questions. I've learned a lot in the last few days.  I have a question with regard to Ford's A-Plan pricing.  Is it possible to negotiate lower than the A-Plan price?..Hi Time Spiral. I just discovered you as part of my next vehicle purchase. I'm looking for a work truck with a hard-to-find configuration. Used vehicles are an option but it's not easy to find them in good shape (being work trucks)...We're not in a rush, and we're waiting for the right used truck while also considering new (known history, warranty and ability to rust proof from the very start make new seem attractive)...There's a truck I like at a dealer a few hours from me. My local dealer has told me they can do a dealer trade and get it in for us. But I want to get the best possible price on this vehicle. Our strength is that we can wait, and that not THAT many people want this specific configuration. Our weakness is that these configurations are not as common, and the truck is not local (it's not that far - just a two-hour drive)...We also have a vehicle to trade - or we could sell privately...Would you recommend negotiating a deal online/by phone with the further dealership? What do we do about trading in that case? Or would it be possible to negotiate with our local dealer and still get a good price even though they'd have to go pick up the truck?..The 'sticker price' on this new truck is $42,000 CAD, and it's offered at $37K CAD after discounts. Would $35K be a reasonable offer?  Also, right now there are a lot of 'incentives' to buy, and those incentives will be gone at the end of the summer. If we don't get our price, and the vehicle is still hanging around at the end of the year, do you think we have another shot? Could we get an even better price even without incentives?..What's true car value for a 2016 Toyota Corolla LE?  Not sure how to bargain with the dealers...@Kelly, such a specific question like that is a little bit beyond the scope of this article, however; general advice suggests that you try and find similar vehicles being sold in the area and compare those prices. And finally, remember this: you're the one with the money. Make an offer and see what happens. If you're willing to pay $7300, and they're asking $8000, offer $7100 then negotiate up to $7300 if you have to. Good luck!..I have a question..I'm looking at a used $7,988 car, and I would like to know whats the average that can come off this price.. I'm looking to spend $7,300 total.. Would coming down this much off price be unreasonable ?..lowest lifeform on the planet is new car sales managers..Section 6 of Strategy 'All the While, Watch the Numbers Carefully' is extremely useful. Information given in this section are of great use. My friend in USA is in the car business for several years. He, I believe woluld love these information...I was just told dealerships can loose their license if they sell below the the 'true car value' estimate . Is this not true. I presume it is...This is an excellent hub and one that everyone should read, so much essential information for every car buyer, nice meeting you Time Spiral an incredible informative extremely helpful and interesting hub. I look forward to following all of your hubs. Linda..@IO,..Important question. And firstly, I'm not a credit consultant--just some guy--so keep that in mind. Credit Checks (i.e., inquiries) are necessary for many transactions; some minor, some major. It is commonly thought that excessive credit inquiries can have negative effects on your score, and this may well be true in some instances, but the credit rating system is designed to take into account the realities of auto and mortgage shopping. In short: don't worry too much about it. My rule-of-thumb was to try and keep like-inquiries close to each other (like, within 30 days or so). This appears to be consistent with Experian's statement on the matter:.."Lenders recognize that shopping for only one car or mortgage does not mean you are trying to open multiple new accounts. Credit scoring systems have been designed to account for that practice and include rules such as counting the same type of inquiry as only one inquiry as long as they are made within a short period of time." --Experian website...When concerning over your credit history, opening new lines of credit, missing payments, defaulting, and percent of account balance per account are far more significant and potentially negative factors...This is great information.  Thank you so much.  Keep up the good work.  Just one question. During the negotiations, when do you let them run your credit?  I have great credit and I don't want the inquiry if they won't give me the right deal...Super info. Thanks. My stomach turns just thinking about car shopping. Even if the salesperson and the dealer are super ethical people, I'm overwhelmed with options in a very short period of time...Thanks for the kind words, pJones. I appreciate the enthusiasm you have for your organization...Conrado,..Thanks for chiming in with your thoughts. Generally speaking, when talking about accessories (i.e., "extras"), you want to identify whether or not you're getting a "deal" or "numbers are just moving around." Generalized example: Your target number is $16k. They come back with $16.5k. Potential strategies might involve (a) countering with a lower price, or (b) asking for additions, such as; accessories, warranties, etc ...; to help you "feel okay" about the higher price...But when you do this, remember, any money added to the price of the vehicle is being financed. So, if they are $500 over your number, and you get $500 worth of accessories added "for free", that may not be the best deal--because now you're paying interest on the additional $500, which over time, could be a significant amount of money. Wouldn't it be much better to say, "Keep the free accessories, and let's lower the price,"? Maybe. Unless you can get a "deal" on the accessories...Consider using the reality of financing to your advantage. Lines like, "financing and paying interest on accessories doesn't help me in the long run. Does it?" Another tact might be to lobby for accessories worth considerably more than the extra amount they're trying to add to the number. For instance: if they want to add $500 to your target number, try and get $1500 worth of free accessories (and settle for slightly less, like $1200). Just don't let the Sales Rep make up the value of floor mats (or whatever). Have Amazon or Walmart up on your phone and show them what the retail value is...I guess what I'm saying with that last bit is: don't let them convince you that the cinnamon air freshener hanging from the rear-view is worth $300. "Look at my phone, Sales Rep, I can buy that same Air Freshener for $8 on Amazon, and it comes in Spearmint too."..Good luck, everyone!..This was really helpful, thank you for the information. I'm currently thinking of leasing my 1st car, a 2015 Honda fit. the model that i'm most interested in has a MSRP of $18,235 and I can spend $15,000 - $17,000. If I negotiate by asking to add minimal accessories like all weather floor mats after the price has been lowered to at-least $16,500, would I be successful?..This really is great advice, and it is so nice to see how you have responded to everyone searching for further assistance...I manage a website for a small used car dealership in the White Mountains of Arizona, and they specialize in vehicles under five thousand that we get from auction. Yes, they are higher in mileage....but they are clean, newer and thoroughly inspected, and did I mention CHEAP!..I guess why I am jumping in here is because they are not your proverbial "used car lot" where they leave room for negotiations. (at all) They are not a "buy here pay here lot", offer no financing, and will not negotiate on the cost...That said, they do encourage people to check the CarFax, see the kelly blue book, and even have a few days window so that you can have it checked out by a mechanic and return it with no questions should you find any major issues. In other words, they sell great products at a great cost, and then stand behind them...Whether someone is searching for a new or used vehicle in this day and age there is just no reason not to do your homework first...Should it be a new car, a post like this can literally save you thousands on the cost! If it is a used vehicle there is no reason you can't check the vin and see the full history of a vehicle, including what it's worth. Then take that extra step (and expense) and let a good mechanic go through it thoroughly, these steps can not only save you money, but a whole lot of aggravation!..Thanks for putting so much effort into this, it really is a great read...I went to a Subaru dealer once just looking at options.  They wanted $14,000 for an older, used vehicle with all salvaged parts under the hood.  It didn't drive very well for that matter, and when I tried to get them to lower their price they wouldn't lower it below $13,000. After that I just walked away.  Great hub.  Great information for anyone looking to buy a car, old or new...With the 2015 models on the lot (we are looking at the Durango), I have found a few local dealerships with 2014 models on the lot. Are they able to come down more with those 2014 models? In just a couple of months next years will start hitting the lots. I was hoping that this would be a benefit to us. What are your thoughts on those types of deals? I have been to Edmund's and pulled info off of there to see the average price on the models we are looking at. Any advice would be greatly appreciated! This was a wonderful article! Tons of helpful info!..You made me feel so much more confident going in to look at some cars in the next week! Thank you!..MJ,..I'm sorry to hear about your experience. I hope you were able to back out of the deal. Most States have a local law that allows you to revoke a contract within the first few days after signing. Look up your area and see if you can leverage this. Otherwise, a simple conversation should be able to stop the contract. "Hey, guys, I realize that I already signed the papers, but upon further inspection of the deal I've decided that I didn't truly understand what I was signing. Now that I do, I would like to rescind my agreement." They will certainly try and save the sale, just stand strong, and perhaps even bring someone along with you as a witness...Sorry for the late response. I'd like to hear about what happened, if you happen across this follow-up response. Best of luck to you!..Could any buddy help me with my question??? Please i wanna finance a 2015 corvette stingray 2Lt z51 package for my bf hes credit is bad in gots repos unpaid bills of all sort but he destroyed he's credit to help me we are both young 21 now i'm finally getting my credit up in wanna get it for him im a first time buyer in don't got alot of credit but i got good down payment $30 000 but i won't be happy in less i get a low car payment in a good interest rate so what do you think. Is it possible plus how much do you think the dealers whould take off the price in should i get it used or new ??? Please help me as much as possible..Hi, Time Spiral,..Thank you for all of this information. I'm stumbling terribly with my first car-buying experience, and I'm learning so much from my mistakes. I've made some bigggg mistakes...A quick summary of my situation: about 2 months ago, my mechanic told me that I should consider trading in my salvaged 2005 Nissan Altima. The work it needed far exceeded the value of the car (which, of, course, isn't much with its tainted title). I got my money's worth out of it, but now I'm in need of a vehicle, and the winters can be harsh where I am, and I'd like something reliable...Mistake #1: I work for an employer that, in collaboration with Subaru of America, offers VIP pricing for new vehicles. If I want to take advantage of this, I need to put a request through, and, in the terms, it says that I should limit my visit to one dealership (it pulls up the closest one to where I live, but I can select a different one in the state if I choose). I put the request through and I've seen the "VIP" pricing for my vehicle of interest, the Subaru XV Crosstrek. It's a $1500 discount...which doesn't seem that "exclusive" the more I'm doing my research. I wish I hadn't put that request through immediately. I'm obviously going to look at other dealerships, too...BIGBIGBIG Mistake #2: I got emotional. I did do the "walking away" tactic (more because I really needed more time to think), but I let my sense of urgency get the best of me, and I locked in a deal on December 31. I spent a lot of time negotiating with some luck, and I left with a headache and a used car to look forward to in a few days (it needs a minor repair first)...I took a better look at my paperwork today, and I'm freaking out. This was NOT a good deal (what do you think? $20k for a used 2013 Crosstrek with 69,000 miles on it--including taxes, fees, etc. plus a 3 yr./36,000 mi. service warranty, GAP insurance).  I already issued a stop payment on my down payment and I'm calling the dealership the first thing in the morning to tell them it's off...Can it really be off even though I've signed all the paperwork? I left the dealership at closing time Dec. 31, today's a holiday, and tomorrow I'm sure they're going to try to deposit that check. Can I really throw in the towel at the last minute and tell them I made a hasty decision?..Needless to say, I really wish I'd done more research before going. The mechanic told me about my car close to the holidays, and my sudden need for a car landed me in not-so-great-of-a-deal. Sorry for the novel. I guess my question is this: can I get out of this deal? I'm embarrassed to go back, but I find a better deal down the road at this dealership, have I lost credibility?..What do you think will be a good discount on 2015 0r 2014..Cadillac SRX with premium package...@Trish,..You have less leverage in the negotiation when the vehicle is high in demand. This certainly means that if the salesman and his managers pass on your offer they can be reasonably certain that someone else will make a "better" offer. If the demand is too high then you might start seeing premiums added to the value and your leverage to negotiate on price drops to near-zero. It is my opinion that in this case--unless you must have that exact vehicle--change your preference to a vehicle that you can negotiate better on...I'm just some guy, but here is what I would do:..(1) Ask which vehicles are less popular. When you've identified one, ask how many they have available on the property, or in their possession at other locations. Remember the number...(2) Ask how many of your target "popular" vehicles they have on the property, or in their possession at other locations. Compare it to the number of less popular cars. This should give you decent idea of how credible their popularity-justifies-this-sale-price claim is...(3) Call their bluff. Make your offer and stick to it. Sure, the vehicle is popular--or so they say--but they have to make the choice: make the sale now, when an offer is on the table, or roll the dice that they can definitely get a better offer soon to replace losing your business...A typical rule of thumb in sales: make the sale. Don't try and follow-up and make the sale later if you can make the sale now!..Also, don't be greedy. If you've been offered something that you're happy with, don't necessarily hold out for an even better offer, especially if it looks unlikely that you have that much leverage. A successful negotiation means both parties are reasonably pleased with the outcome...Good luck!..Hi Time Spiral ~ I love all the information on this page.  Have a question if the vehicle is a easy sell does that mean they won't budge?  I am looking for a 2015 Jeep Cherokee Sport and they seem to be working with me?  I have two dealers tell me the other one can't go down that low.  I have them down almost 25%.  What do you think?..I guess prices vary with vintage and make/type of Car/ SUV...But some good points mentioned here..How much should I expect to get off for taking a showroom car?..I can confirm that this will work at most dealers. I actually did this without thinking much about it. I walked in and told them my budget, they tried to give me a lower model vehicle to meet my budget but told them that my trade-in car has better features than what they're giving me and I didn't feel they were being fair with how much they were giving me for my trade-in. I ended up walking but they did manage to lower the price on the car I wanted by around 3000! At the end of the day it wasn't enough but it goes to show how much you can barter with dealerships...I'm in the market this month to find a Kia Optima SX. I was wondering what your opinion was on using the KBB form to send my info off to 3 dealerships near me, then sitting on them finding me deals on the right car for the right color rather than running to the dealerships first. What are your thoughts on that? Also, I've seen a few commenters post about not being able to talk them down quite as much as your article says for a new car. Any insider info on how that works with Kia? I see truecar shows it for $24,620. Would it be so bad to try and get them down to 21K or start at 20K?..Hello Time Spiral, great article.  I really find this helpful and plan on using it for my first car purchase.  I'm a 21 year old student entering my senior year in college, hopefully starting a job soon in order to split the payment with my parents...I know what car I want, but I will make sure not to show my hand at the dealerships.  Would you happen to know if Kia has these kinds of big markups and cash incentives for the salesmen/dealership?  Just asking so I can get my facts straight when I am in the negotiation process.  Need to know if I am able to work my way down a couple thousand dollars and have some bells and whistles added as well, with no additional cost...Also, on standard base trims that don't have the option of adding leather seats when you are building a car online, is it possible to have it added to the base trim at the dealership as a part of the negotiation process?..@McNeil,..Great observations and contributions. Thank you!..While I agree with most of what has been posted. Not all brands have huge mark-up. Honda, for example does not fleet vehicles, nor does the company offer volume bonuses to dealerships, and does not have several thousand in profit to "drop-off" the price. Before making an offer it is always a good idea to take a quick look at Car-Cost because not all brands use the same mark-up and do not have the same wiggle room...This one is definitely one of the best guidance article for a new car buyer. I have been going through the exact situation you have mentioned here and your article has certainly boost my level of confidence to deal with any damn dealer now. I signed up only to reply to your article...Thanks much!..Im looking to buy a new 2012 f-150. no special bells an whistles like power seats or pedals. i just want what i need like a cd player or aux port for my music power windows i like but the sync and sat radio navigation is out the question and more things to go wrong on the truck/car as my gradfather would say(they dont make cars like they use to). So here is my situation im young mid 20's and to get a good price as i researched i need a cosigner which my mommy will do. My mom is like old school tells it like it is and yes she has went with me to buy and the numbers wasn't right so she got up an left im like mom that was rude lol, an dont want me to buy a new car unless the price is right, she dont want me to buy new pretty much anyway she says its a big investment and all that stuff. i make good money at my job but ive never bought a new/used car for over 5k so me financing myself is just dumb. So here is my ? im looking at at 2012 f150  msrp is $34500 i think. minus the rebates and all that stuff takes it down to $29.5 which to me is a good price but still alot of money im a tight wad thanks to mom haha.. So what im asking you TS is what is a good offer for this truck? Should i throw out 25k to the sales or lower 23k Please help..  And also just say the rims i dont really like or the color isn't right can u tell the salesman to go down just because you dont like the color or rims an the truck/car is the one you want with all features you like?..Nicely done. Very informative, and gives you confidence in my next purchase...You said to pay with cash. The dealership says that have 0% interest on 48 months for a 2012 Highlander. Is that not true and we should stil pay cash?..hi i have a similar case with Jedgar, so how long does the price go down after the car had reach its 1 year mark?..The absolute KEY to buying a car is....they will promise you ANYTHING. They will say ANYTHING to get you to buy. Then they will change the deal just before you sign the contract. Its the oldest scam in the book and it's called "Bait and Switch". GET IT IN WRITING and get your own copy to keep. Make sure you have a copy of the factory order or the sales work sheet to bring with you when you sign the sales agreement. They are ALL 100% dishonest. They will fast talk you and they will try avoid giving you a copy of the work sheet which includes the full delivered price. You MUST know the "out the door price"...the grand total. The amount you are going to have to write the check for....BEFORE you sign anything. Copies of everything...get their business card. Get names and dates. Be observant. Take notes. Make sure they SEE you taking notes. Have a script for yourself to go by and don't let them distract you from your script. DO NOT let them double team you. Work with one sales representative, period, and do NOT let him keep getting up from the office to go talk with the manager behind your back. If he does, WALK AWAY FROM THE DEAL. They are triple teaming you and they do this EVERY DAY OF THEIR LIFE. You don't stand a chance when they are tripe teaming you. The junior salesman, the senior salesman (good cop-bad cop) and the unseen salesmanager in the back office. (The wizzard of Oz)..Jen, the nature of negotiating is that you have some leverage. When demand is super high, and there are people lined up behind you, it can be difficult to negotiate much off the price...Your best bet is to follow the basic advice of reaching out to the enthusiast community and try and find out if there are any factory, dealer, or corporate rebates available. If there are, and you know them, I would attempt to negotiate those rebates off the price...Good luck!..Hi, awesome advice! I bought a 2012 Prius V last month and now my husband wants to buy a 2012 Camry Hybrid. I think I got a decent deal for my Prius considering market conditions, but know that I definitely would have been able to negotiate it down more if only hybrids weren't in such demand with the skyrocketing gas prices. Now we are in the same position again, but this time for the Camry Hybrid my husband wants. How do I get the best deal for a car that is in such high demand?? The car he wants has an msrp of $31,500 and according to the dealer, they can't keep them on the lot. (While we were there, two cars sold.) How much flexibility do we really have in negotiating? My husband's current car isn't very gas efficient at 19mpg and while we aren't in a hurry, we would like to stop paying outrageous prices to fill his tank every week since he pays $80+/ week in gas alone. Thanks!!..Awesome info bud!!  Going to buy my first car with my GF.  This will help give me some ammo when going back to the dealership!!..Your rock!  Don't stop the BLOGGIN'!..@Jedgar,..I apologize, but I'm not familiar with the "D" plan, but what I can tell you if that towards the end of a model year is always a good time to negotiate the price of a vehicle...Don't pay much attention to the INVOICE price of the vehicle, as that is largely fictional in most cases. What you want to focus on is a few things: (1) Fair Market Value of the vehicle you're interested in, (2) Leveraging your trade, and (3) Making sure you use any Manufacturer, Retailer, and Local rebates being offered to your advantage. You can discover these by joining enthusiast communities online, or doing some research about the specific dealership you intend to buy from...I hope this helps!..Time Spiral - I have the ability to buy a car on a "D" plan which I believe will help me get a low price.  The question I have is when 2013 models start to come to the dealerships will the invoice that the dealer pays go down?  In other words if the dealer invoice is currently $30,000 on a 2012 will that $30,000 go down to say $28,000 as the manufacturer's try to reduce inventory to create room for 2013?..@Salesman, Did you read the article? The following is pulled directly from the article:.."Don't be bitter. "Profit" is not a dirty word. Remember that. Don't get disenfranchised, or upset that the dealership is going to make money of your purchase, or that the salesmen is going to benefit from your sale. Be happy that you can also get a good deal, the dealership make money, and the salesmen can make a living. The balance is real, and achievable..."Excessive Profit" is definitely a dirty word. Excessive profit translates directly into negative equity for the buyer. No matter what, you want to avoid negative equity as much as humanly possible."..Just something to ponder..is it om to ask a salesman to give up all his profit..doesn't he deserve to feed his family..no profit..no check.! You can't expect him to give away ever car deal! Just saying....Very useful page! It's important to be a bit savvy when looking/buying...Craig,..Regardless of what type of business you're doing, if the vendor makes fun of you, do not do business with them...Call around, keep looking. Have a few salesmen looking up deals for you. It takes work, but it will happen for you...Remember; just like any industry, the auto-dealer industry can be a dirty, grimy, pitiful thing. If you were treated poorly, vote with your dollar, never go back...Hi Time Spiral, this is an ultimate 'homework' for car buyers, also the comments gave a lot of ideas. However here is what happened to me today, I am kind of planning to purchase 2012 Dodge Grand Caravan SE MSRP'd at 23K and went to Car dealer and told that I am king of seeking 19K as the price for it, and the dealer actually made fun of me, I was kind of embarrassed and moved out saying I have few dealers on my list of visit and returned straight home :(. Is it that idiotic demand to seek discount of 18% considering this is towards end of the year and the brand is like Dodge and not popular like Toyota or Honda?..Any tips, suggestion what should I do?..I used to work for a car distribtion company. We could print those so called window stickers and invoices all day long! lol They can make them say whatever they want too!..Robbielo,..Thanks for the kind remarks! Just by looking at it, it certainly seems like that is possible, but I really do not know. You need to do a little bit of research: Does the dealer get incentives or rebates? Is that model selling well already, or is it struggling? What have other people purchased that model year for?..Since your purchase is a ways off, one of the best things you can do is find a Volkswagen enthusiast website, with a forum, join it, maybe join two, or three, and start making friends. When it comes time to start negotiating you will have a wealth of resources available to you to make a strong argument for a lower price...Good luck!..@Time Sprial you have no idea how helpfu, simple, and detailistic(not a word i know) this is. i mean wow. great info. my question is i want to purchase a 2012 volkswagen jetta gli. with the options i choose its msrp is about 27k do you think they will bring it down to 21 at all? i just want to know what to expect since its a german brand and its 2012 but i wont be maing the purchase till about may/april 2012. just wanted to see what your insight is on this. thanks a lot...Good luck, Raven!..You sound like an intelligent young woman and I'm sure you'll do fine. One thing that you can do is post your vehicle on Craigslist, or car trader, or other similar site and start getting offers, or having conversations...They don't want you to leave and if you have a private party negotiation going on for your trade vehicle, you can just say, "Alright, well, I have a private sale in the works for this vehicle. They offered me $X, so unless you can match that I am going to wait and come back after the deal is finalized."..It's a decent tactic to use while simultaneously expanding your options...Good luck!..I think this was great advice, but I'm in the same boat as Sarah and people don't take young women seriously when we're trying to buy a car, fortunately for me, my grandfather was a car salesman and I learned a few tricks from him. Like buying a car on December 31st, so you can argue that give me this car for the price I want, and you don't have to put it on next years taxes. Another thing I can use as leverage is paying in cash, something my Grandfather did when he bought my mom a new car was he brought like 20k in cash to the dealership and when they tried to be stubborn about the price he pulled out the wad of cash and started counting it in front of them, and when he threw out his number, he didn't move, they did until they got to HIS price which was about 10k less than what they were asking for. I am trading my car and because I know they will try and low ball me on that I'm gonna ask them how much could I sell it to a friend for, then "change my mind" and be in a better negotiating place for a trade in price. A dirty trick I know, but it's gonna keep them honest, and not take advantage of my gender and age. Now I'm in the first stages of my plan but I'm hoping it will work out well, but it gets confusing when they start talking about MSRP and Invoice, about how much a car is worth, but then you'll see amazing deals like $10,000 off MSRP and it's like how can you do that when it says Invoice is only like $1,500 less than the MSRP and I really wish my Grandfather was still here to be able to help me with this, because even at 80 he could still wheel and deal with the best of them...Takeing your Dad or someone more used to the process would only prove how smart and savy you are...@Jay,..It is true that there are some models that are not negotiated for, but this is very rare. The only time this happens is when the vehicle is in such high demand that they do not need to negotiate to make sales. This is not the norm...It's a big purchase. Be willing to put in the work. Join an Audi enthusiast website that has a forum and start asking questions. You'll learn about dealer rebates and incentives and can use those to your advantage...Good luck!..Hi, thank you for these very useful tips. I am wondering if the negotiations, to lower the price, work for German makes too? Specifically the Audi A4. I am interested in buying this car, its MSRP brand new is around $34K give or take. I have seen some pre owned cars with very little mileage for around $30K online, and if I look even deeper I can even find some at $29K, with a few more miles of course. But can these makes be negotiable as well? Thanks!..@Sarah, You're welcome. Feel free to send me a message if you'd like to discuss this further...Thank you for the advice! I really appreciate it!..@Sarah,..I'm not sure how much I'm going to be able to help you in comments, but I will try...(1) You have the money. Without you there is no deal. The salesman needs to try and maintain power in the negotiation or he may not succeed...(2) If they are flirting, or coming on to you, or making you feel uncomfortable in any way, like calling you "honey" you can diminish the behavior by not responding, or leaving...(3) In very rare scenarios a dealer may not be able to move on MSRP. But this is rare. This is usually for new models for verhicles that are in extremely high demand. Don't buy these vehicles...(4) It's really important to do research before hand. If you know the type of vehicle you want, visit and join forums. Reach out to people. The wealth of knowledge that is out there is vast. Enthusiast forums will often know about dealer rebates, special offers, and can offer very niche negotiating tips...(5) If the salesmen is unable to move, get up and leave. Seriously. If the dealer says, "Maybe I can deal with your Dad," you can say, "actually, I've four other dealerships on my schedule today. Have a nice day." and leave...There is a good chance they will realize you mean business and start to negotiate. If they don't, the actually leave...I hope this helps!..I'm about to buy my first car and I'm terrified!! I've graduated college, have a great career and am finally ready to purchase an SUV "of my dreams".  My problem: I am young (20's) and look even younger! How do I negotiate and still be taken seriously? Although I don't know everything there is to cars and the financing, I am intelligent and do know what I am able to spend. The dealers I have met with tend to call me honey and sweetie and insist that they cannot move the MSRP. The last I looked at- MSRP $43000 I wanted to stay around $40000 and they laughed at me, telling me that maybe if I brought my Dad he could deal with them for me. I love my Dad, but I am financially stable with great credit and would like to buy a car MYSELF, but am not good at being "aggressive".  HELP!!!..This is a terrific hub and just shows what hubbers are all about...Not only do I suspect you will get decent traffic but you are also helping people save thousands of dollars...This is most certainly the type of hub I want on my blog...The hub is up on my blog now.  You can find the link to my blog on my profile page...Cheers..Dale..@Green Lotus..Find the "true value" of any vehicle is a tricky art. If the dealer says the vehicle is worth $25,000 but it is still sitting on the lot 10 months later, then that vehicle is clearly not actually worth that, according to the market, or it would be sold...I think one of the best things to do is join the online communities pertaining to the vehicle make and model you're going to buy and learn about the discount, rebates, and incentive programs that go on behind the scenes. Don't actually "play" those cards at the deal, but just know "This guy can still come down a little"...It's not unreasonable to 'offer a number' 25% lower than MSRP, and expect the dealer to come down, but expecting him to sell at that number might be tough. This is where your trade comes in BIG time. If your trade is paid off? even better.  Thanks, Lotus!..This is great information TS. Thank you for doing so much research and laying it out so clearly. I love your step by step advice and will share it with many of my friends and relatives! One question though. I'm assuming it's not unreasonable to shoot for about 27% off the MSRP? For me, the hardest part is figuring out the true "fair deal" number before the negotiations begin... or .. and post using a HubPages Network account...No HTML is allowed in comments, but URLs will be hyperlinked.

How to Negotiate Your Used Vehicle Purchase | CARPROOF Resource Centre
https://www.carproof.com/resource-centre/articles/how-to-negotiate-your-used-vehicle-purchase

CARPROOF has tips and information to help you buy and sell your used car, maintain your vehicle and much more.

You?ve found a vehicle that is right for you, and are ready to talk with the seller about a potential agreement. When it comes to negotiating the price, the key is to settle on a deal that benefits both parties. Here are some things you should keep in mind before you commit:.. Look into the make and model of the vehicle that you want to buy. Check out the Canadian Red Book, the Canadian Black Book or use AutoTrader.ca?s Value Finder tool to see what the average price of that make and model of vehicle is. You can also scan the classified ads in your local newspaper or car buying ads to see what the going rate for your make and model is locally. You should investigate that particular vehicle to see if there are any common issues with this model. If so, you?ll want to ask the seller and inquire about this during a pre-purchase inspection by your preferred mechanic... There are several things that can influence the selling price of a car: the age, the mileage, the wear and tear both inside and out, how well it was cared for, any flaws or mechanical issues it may have, the car?s accessories and added features and any recent updates made to the car... A CarProof Vehicle History Report will tell you if the vehicle has ever been in accident, if there are any outstanding liens on the car as well as give you insight into the registration and branding history... Get an independent, licensed mechanic to give the vehicle a detailed inspection. Bring your CarProof report with you as you?ll want to verify that any accident damage was properly repaired... If you?re purchasing the vehicle privately, keep in mind that when you register your vehicle, you?ll have to pay sales tax on the price you paid for the vehicle (if you?re purchasing through a dealer, then this will be part of that purchase process). Check with your provincial licensing office so you know how much you?ll be required to hand over... Before going in to the sales office, determine what amount is the highest price you?re willing to pay for that particular vehicle...If you?re going to make the offer with your significant other, make sure you?re both on the same page. Talk about your strategy beforehand and together decide what your ideal price is and determine your maximum price. Arguing or questioning each other later, in front of the seller, won?t help you get a better deal... If the CarProof report does reveal that the vehicle has been damaged, check to make sure the vehicle has been properly repaired. Ask to see if this incident has impacted the vehicle in any other way. The same goes with any issues that are discovered during the pre-purchase inspection as well as any visible damage or flaws ? don?t be afraid to bring it up! These things could influence the price of the vehicle and give you more room for negotiation... Sometimes another opportunity to get more value for the price you pay is through add-ons. Examples of this are things like under-coating, or other services. If these are items you like or might have purchased anyway, then they could be a great thing to ask about to gain more value for your purchase price... Don?t give the seller a lowball offer that?s way below the seller?s asking price. You?ll risk insulting the seller and they probably won?t want to negotiate with you any further...When you make your offer to the seller, say it with confidence. Don?t mutter it, or say it in a way that makes your price seem like an uncertain question. Be assertive and state the offer in a way that shows the seller you?re serious... When you?re bartering back and forth with the seller, don?t get angry, pushy or arrogant and take caution if you find the seller acting this way. Keep in mind that the goal of the negotiating process is to find a fair price that both you and the seller can be happy with... If the seller makes a counteroffer and you?d like to think about it, that?s ok. Let the seller know ? buying a car is a big decision and not one you want to rush into. If the seller has other potential buyers, then know that you could lose out on the car if you wait...CARPROOF provides the most comprehensive and reliable vehicle history reports in Canada, giving you peace of mind when you purchase a car. Never buy a car without a CARPROOF report.

The Car Guide ? Everything Automotive, 51 Years Running....By........Photo: Dominic Dubreuil..Each year, the DesRosiers firm compiles a large amount of data on vehicle sales throughout the country; after analyzing that data, it can provide a pretty accurate statement about the health of the automotive industry...The most recent data shows the average price paid for a new vehicle in Canada. On average we paid $27,563 for a 2015 model-year car; for a truck (including light, medium and heavy-duty) the amount is higher, at $40,001...This is a 1.4% rise compared to last year?s average car price, and 1% for trucks...According to DesRosiers, these results are interesting because despite the fact that cars are better-equipped than ever, prices don?t vary much...2015 will also be interesting to follow; the value of the Canadian dollar has dropped, which means that every company that imports goods has a smaller margin of profit, including car manufacturers...The Car Guide is the benchmark of excellence for the Canadian automotive landscape.

Get the Best Price on Your Next Car by Never Setting Foot on the Lot Until You?re Ready to Buy
http://lifehacker.com/5990461/get-the-best-price-on-your-next-car-by-never-setting-foot-on-the-lot-until-youre-ready-to-buy

 Shopping for a car can be a nightmare. Finding the right vehicle, getting your financing together, and shopping around for the best price are all a pain, but you can do almost all of them from the comfort of your home. No sales pressure, no car salesmen, and no hassle. 

 Shopping for a car can be a nightmare. Finding the right vehicle, getting your financing together, and shopping around for the best price are all a pain, but you can do almost all of them from the comfort of your home. No sales pressure, no car salesmen, and no hassle. ..The folks at .. have a great list of things that car salesmen would rather you didn't know before you walked in, but one of the suggestions that stood out to us is that you don't even need to go to the lot until you're ready to buy. Even car dealers that haven't moved to fixed pricing will still give you quotes online for the type of vehicle you want, and you can use those to shop around multiple dealers in your area...Manufacturer web sites will give you the base price of the vehicle, and a phone call or email to a sales associate at a dealership will give you a quote on the same vehicle with the options you want. If the associate wants to drag you down to the showroom, just email another or let them know you will?they'll usually straighten them out. Here's Wise Bread's suggestion:..The Internet has done wonders for the humble consumer. With it, you can email 20 dealers within a 50 mile radius, tell them what you're looking for, and ask them to send you back a quote. From those quotes, pick the lowest couple and take those to any dealership you want. They'll usually be forced to match it, destroying whatever profit margin they were hoping for. And before you feel too bad, the dealerships get massive bonuses by hitting certain sales targets. They can give you the car at cost and still walk away with a nice pile of cash...Granted, this only works if the dealers are up front with you on their costs, so your mileage may vary. Still, it's a great and easy way to shop around without having to take up your entire weekend going from dealership to dealership asking about pricing, sitting in some salesperson's uncomfortable chairs, and deflecting their attempts to upsell you on warranties and services you know you don't need. Just remember though, once you get your quote, you'll still have to go to the dealership eventually (unless they're willing to seal the deal via email) so you may get the upsell then...If you don't have much luck with the direct approach, check with your bank or credit union (whoever's doing your financing?you are doing your financing through someone other than the dealership, right?) to see if they have a car buying program or offer car buying brokers to help you get the best deal on a vehicle. Often those services stick you with select dealerships if you participate though, so make sure you read the fine print before signing up for one. Still, they can often yield competitive pricing...Finally, check out services like .. .. or .. and .. ... Hit the link below for some more car buying tips... .. .... | Wise Bread

Car Price Remains Important, But Not at All Costs | Dealer content from WardsAuto
http://wardsauto.com/dealer/car-price-remains-important-not-all-costs

New Autotrader study indicates most auto dealership customers see no difference between lowest price and fair and transparent prices.?

')})();//-->..  ....Price remains important to car buyers. Jared Rowe readily notes that...?At some point, price has to factor in,? says the president of Cox Automotive?s Media Division, which includes Autotrader, an online automotive marketplace, and Kelley Blue Book, a vehicle-pricing provider ...But citing results of a new Cox study, Rowe says, ?Low price and transparent or fair price are the same in the consumer?s mind.?..That?s significant, he says. ?We think this is a big deal. It means it doesn?t have to be about continuing profit margin pressures,? an effect on dealers competing solely on price. ?..In this case, ?fair? pricing means competitive pricing, or being in the game. If an online shopper is doing a lowest-to-highest price check on a vehicle, dealers appearing on the fifth or sixth web page of search results essentially are sidelined. ??..?If pricing isn?t in a specific range, it isn?t perceived as fair,? Rowe tells .....Transparent pricing means, among other things, what customers see online and elsewhere is what they get at the dealership. Transparency reflects openness and consistency across marketing and sales channels...The study found that the top three dealer differentiators in terms of importance and desirability are:?transparent prices, honesty and transparency of dealer service departments and the competitiveness finance rates dealers offer. The study says 90% of consumers expect those things...Dealers who openly demonstrate price fairness and transparency build consumer confidence, Rowe says. ?It puts more focus on value and less on price negotiations...?It represents a shift in how retailers approach the sales process.?..It also speeds up deals and fosters long-term dealer-customer relationships...?Only 20% of consumers absolutely want the lowest price,? he says. ?Eighty percent want a fair price. If I?m looking for more buyers, I don?t think I?d focus on that 20%.???..According to the study, top consumer frustrations are negotiating a purchase price and finding the best deal (39%), lengthy transactions marked by filling out lots of paperwork (27%) and negotiating a trade-in value (21%)...Cox polling also indicates that if the car-buying process got better, 72% of shoppers would visit dealerships more and 53% would buy cars more often.??..Many dealers use the Internet and other means to try to extend their market reach. But the research indicates reach alone may not produce the best results. Instead, it may behoove some dealers to rein it in and target the right audience...Rowe says Cox Automotive offers products and services that help dealers differentiate themselves, from Kelley Blue Book?s Price Advisor (featuring third-party validation) to Autotrader?s formatted inventory listings to an ?Instant Cash Offer? program that gives online trade appraisals and offers guarantees to both dealers and customers...?It is incredibly important for dealers to tell their story of differentiation,? Rowe says. ?There is no single answer. Get really good at three or four things, not necessarily everything. A very important question is ?What do I want to be??..?Consumers are looking for differentiators that focus on peace of mind and help them feel they are making the right decision. It could range from dealers offering maintenance plans to some sort of return offer. There are multiple ways to scratch that consumer itch.?..Dealers can stand out by strategically focusing on priority differentiators that emphasize transparency, consistency, trust and the elimination of friction, he says. ?There?s no one way to succeed in the car business. But if you are the lowest-price store, you need an incredible operational system, something like Walmart.? ?..Rowe sees Cox?s role in it all as a ?matchmaker? between dealers and customers. ?This is about bringing buyers and sellers together, with an outcome that feels better and is more profitable on both sides. These are tools that, when leveraged properly, show incredible results.?..He calls out the San Francisco-area?s Del Grande Dealer Group as an auto-retailing success story. It touts its ?No Brainer Pricing? based on third-party sources and ?Project 100? meaning 100% satisfaction to 100% of customers 100% of the time...An Autotrader study on the Del Grande organization indicates its approach has spurred incremental sales in both the showroom and service department...?They institutionalized a philosophy they feel strongly about, and they have a lot of happy, repeat customers,? Rowe says...Rowe describes the move towards fair and transparent pricing as part of a ?retail evolution.?..Not a retail revolution?..?No, I don?t want to diminish the good work that?s been done in recent years; work that has made the car-purchase process 10 times better. So it?s an evolution, but a fast-moving one.?..He adds: ?Dealers are incredibly sophisticated entrepreneurs. People don?t give them enough credit.?..God help us!  Another survey.  Instead of seeing how consumers answer survey questions why not observe how consumers actually behave.  Better yet, just ask the people who deal with them daily...Interesting how someone dismisses a survey or study based on what they desire the results to be instead of learning from and reacting to them. I find it ironic that the study results, along with  what I consistently get as feedback from many consumers I interact with, are similar to the above article and are quite often in opposition to what your articles and comments attempt to sell us.......Sponsored Introduction

What Determines The Price Of My Auto Insurance Policy? | III
http://www.iii.org/article/what-determines-price-my-auto-insurance-policy

Many factors can affect your auto insurance premium.

The average yearly auto insurance premium is around $800, but there is wide variation around this average. Many factors can affect your premium, and they all help determine how likely you are to have an accident. Perhaps surprisingly, many of them do a better job than just your driving record. Not all companies use all of these factors, and some might use factors not listed here. Your premium may depend on, in no particular order:..?..The better your record, the lower your premium. If you have had accidents or serious traffic violations, it is likely you will pay more than if you have a clean driving record. You may also pay more if you are a new driver and have not been insured for a number of years...?..The more miles you drive, the more chance for accidents. If you drive your car for work, or drive it a long distance to work, you will pay more. If you drive only occasionally?what some companies call ?pleasure use?, you will pay less...?..Where you live and where the car is parked can affect the cost of your insurance. Generally, due to higher rates of vandalism, theft and accidents, urban drivers pay a higher auto insurance price than those in small towns or rural areas...?..Other factors that vary from one area or state to another are: cost and frequency of litigation; medical care and car repair costs; prevalence of auto insurance fraud; and weather trends...?..In general, mature drivers have fewer accidents than less experienced drivers, particularly teenagers. So insurers generally charge more if teenagers or young people below age 25 drive your car...?..As a group, women tend to get into fewer accidents, have fewer driver-under-the-influence accidents (DUIs) and most importantly less serious accidents than men. So, all other things being equal, women generally pay less for auto insurance than men. Of course, over time individual driving history for both men and women will have a greater impact on what they pay for auto insurance...?..Some cars cost more to insure than others. Variables include the likelihood of theft, the cost of the car itself is major rate factor, the cost of repairs, and the overall safety record of the car. Engine sizes, even among the same makes and models, can also impact insurance premiums. Cars with high quality safety equipment might qualify for premium discounts...Insurers not only look at how safe the car is to drive and how well it protects occupants, they also look at the potential damage a car can inflict on another car. If a specific car has a higher chance of inflicting damage on another car and its occupants, some insurers may charge more for liability insurance...?..For many insurers, credit-based insurance scoring is one of the most important and statistically valid tools to predict the likelihood of a person filing a claim and the likely cost of that claim. Credit-based insurance scores are based on information like payment history, bankruptcies, collections, outstanding debt and length of credit history. For example, regular, on-time credit card and mortgage payments affect a score positively, while late payments affect a score negatively...?..In virtually every state, by law you must buy a minimum amount of liability insurance. The state required limits are generally very low and most people should consider purchasing much more than the state requirement?the recommended amount of liability protection is about ten times the average state minimum. If you have a new or recent model of car, you likely will also buy comprehensive and collision coverage, which pays for damage to your car due to weather, theft or physical damage to the car such as being hit by a tree. Comprehensive and collision coverages are subject to deductibles; the higher the deductible, the lower your auto insurance premium. While there is no legal requirement to purchase these coverages, if you finance the purchase of the car or you lease it you may be required by contract...?..Perhaps just as important, insurers NEVER use race or religion to set rates. Such practices are illegal. Insurers believe them to be abhorrent as well.

Cost vs. value: Should you buy a new car or used car?
http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/cost-vs-value-should-you-buy-a-new-or-used-car/

Almost every personal finance pundit recommends you should buy a used car over a new car. I disagree. Here's why I chose to buy a new car.

Get the entire word-for-word email funnel that generated $400,000 from a single launch and apply it to your own business...179 Comments- Get free updates of new posts ..In college, I drove a rickety-ass minivan that my parents let me use. Here?s how bad it was: It shook so badly that when I drove it on the freeway, I always drove in the right lane so that .. it broke down?not ..?I could simply pull over gracefully. When I took it to get a smog check, which of course it failed, I just put my head in my hands. The funniest thing is that one day my dad went to get new tires for the van and he came back with whitewall tires. I don?t know if any of us are old enough to know what whitewall tires are, so here?s a picture from Steelthundercc.com:..I always found it odd that almost every personal-finance pundit recommends buying a used car instead of a new car. (Here?s a .. submitted by readers where you can see) Why is there such universal agreement? Apparently, among the reasons they list, cars depreciate quickly, they?re built better than ever, used cars have lower insurance, etc ? so every young person should buy used...I disagree. Now, used cars can be a good way to go. But to apply a broad rule that ?used is the best? is idiotic. ... Here?s why I chose to buy a new car...I was in my last year of college with lots of business meetings that I would rather not have missed because my stupid 12-year-old van broke down. In November, I started looking for a car to buy. This was intentional: You can get amazing deals at the end of the year when dealers want to beat their quotas. First, I test-drove a few cars and researched them, narrowing it down to a Honda Accord or a Mercedes C230. (Both were 4-door models because Indian people hate coupes. Seriously.)..Now I want to take a second to explain how I decided between the two. The Mercedes was sporty and cool and kinda affordable (if a little bit of a stretch for me). But I decided against it for a few reasons: Service is absurdly expensive and I would just be angry every time I had to get stuff done at a dealer, plus insurance is more, etc. But the real reason I didn?t want to get the Mercedes is, where do you go from there? You can?t get a Geo Prism after driving a Mercedes for a few years. So I decided it would be stupid to get a Mercedes as a 22-year-old. Plus, cars are important to me, but not .. important...I decided to get a Honda Accord. Now I had to choose between new or used...Sure, a new car costs more. But over the long-term, not .. much more. And the value?not just monetarily?is much higher. Here are a few things I debated before choosing:..Here?s the deal: Buying a crappy used car will save you up-front money, but it may cost you a lot more over the long-term. If you decide to buy a pretty good used car, in my opinion you might as well spend a little more to mitigate the risks of car repair, etc. That?s the risk/reward perspective...Another perspective, cost vs. value, influenced me more. Buying a new car seems scary because they numbers are so high ($20,000!). But that?s what financing is for?especially at extremely low rates like 2-4%. You can put down as much money as you?re comfortable with. But the biggest factor in my purchase was the total-value concept: You can get a new car for a relatively low cost over the long term by doing a few sensible things...Now, most of the pundits who talk about buying new vs. used seem to assume that people are completely stupid and will do things like pick a bad car that looks sexy but is poor choice financially (e.g., a Dodge Neon vs. a Honda Accord), spend a lot on the initial purchase price, not shop around for competitive insurance, not take good care of the car, and sell it when they see something shinier...If you do these things, then yes, you are a moron...But if you actually think about this, one of the biggest purchases you?ll ever make, you can save a .. of money. So do some commonsense things that will make you much happier over the long term:..Ok, so I decided to get a new car. Let?s assume my car cost $20,000 ($25k sticker price, negotiated). If I can pay it off in 5 years, and drive it for 3 years afterwards, I can sell my car for about $10,000. (Extrapolate data from .. and realize that it?s a bit hand-wavy.) That?s about $1,250/year. And it only gets better as you drive the car longer with no payments. In other words, you save more in non-payments than the car depreciates...Now, some caveats: First, don?t forget insurance, registration, repair, etc. But remember that a used car has all these things, too?just in different amounts. (In my case, insurance for a 5-yr-old used car would save me about $100 every 6 months?not very compelling.) With a used car, the risk goes up (likelihood of repair increases, resale value decreases). The question is whether the reward of lower payments is worth it. Second, this doesn?t work with all cars. If you?re buying a Dodge Neon, your resale value is going to suck and you?re going to be angry every day of your life...I expect this post will generate a lot of debate, and that?s cool. Here?s the bottom line: I don?t like when pundits say that buying a used car is the only way to go. It?s not. Buying a new car can be a smart choice if you pick the right car, negotiate extremely well, and stay disciplined about shopping for insurance, maintaining your car, etc. (It doesn?t have to be a purely numbers-oriented decision. I love my car?it?s fun to drive and if I had 10x the money, I would still get it.) Because buying a car is such a big purchase, I?m fine spending a little more money and time up front to mitigate risk and get a great car that will last for a long time. And by being sensible about how long you drive your car for (longer is better), you can get a new car for a great value...Whether you?re buying a car or trying to find your Dream Job, earn more on the side, or become successful, it?s important to have the right information and a system that works. I want to share one of my favorite systems that makes finance pain-free and automatic ? so you?ll have plenty of money for drinks and travel, retirement, bills, and your next car.............          ..How do you know when to make a career change? Sometimes, the right path isn't clear.Senior year of college, .....Does any of this sound familiar??I hate small talk, let?s just get to the point???We started small .....                        .. Comments on "Cost vs. value: Why I bought a new car"                    ..Are you still alive?..buy new car and used online free shipping just click here or copy paste ..Of course it?s not just about saving money! I like cars and if money weren?t an issue, of course I?d prefer a new car. But I?m just pointing out that the pundits don?t have a universal lock on saying ?used is better.? ..I?ll pass your compliment to my dad, too...In my opinion, if you?re going to buy a new car, you need to sell it and buy a new one in the next five years. It?s absolutely pointless to buy new and run it into the ground. Either buying old and killing the car is better, or buying new and selling it is better...I don?t agree that new cars are a better value, but I do agree that you should not spend a lot of money on something you don?t like. ..BTW?Is there some reason why indians hate coupes, or is it genetic?..I bought a new car instead of a used car for one reason and one reason only: because I wanted to. I wanted a vehicle that was mine from day one to day $the_last. I really wanted a MINI Cooper, and that?s what I got. I threw cost efficiency out the window and went with my heart. (Of course, MINIs are very good for the money, so it wasn?t a purely .. decision either.)..Although you mentioned being a hardball negotiator as part of your buying process, what happened to being a hardball investigator?..A good used car with low mileage, perhaps only 1-3 years old, will still sell for thousands less, and have a warranty + much of the reliability of a new car. Researching vehicle history and carefully examining a car on the lot can be fruitful...I feel this update was written with a ?brand new? vs. ?ridiculously old? mentality, and didn?t benefit from an analysis of the shades of gray...My two cents! Thanks!..Exactly. Upgraded used car with low miles >  new car with no miles. A nearly new used car is way less money and comes with all the luxuries of brand new. If you dont know how to do basic maintenance you shouldn?t be buying a new car in the first place...When the pundits say ?used car? I don?t think that they mean another peace of clunker that?s bound to fall apart...When they say ?used?, they simply mean a car that has been driven for a little bit. They mean a car that has less than 20-30k miles on it. They mean a car that has had no accidents and has had a good maintenance record...If I could save $2,000 or more on a car just because somebody decided to drive it for 1,000 miles and sell it, I will take the offer...There is a difference between a 12 year old used car and a 2-4 year old used car.  Typically cars lose 10-30% of their value in the trip from the dealer?s lot to your driveway at home.  Although buying used can make sense if you are prepared to own the car for an extended period of time (more than 5 years) I personally think that 2 year old cars provide much better value...Ram, your losing credibility with post like these.  There is no way that buying a car new is better financially on average than buying a 1 to 4 year old car.  First year depreciation is too big...Got a 2003 Honda Civic right as the 2004s came out (~late Sept. 2003).  Dealer wanted to sell the 2003s he had, cut a good deal.  Paid up front the cost of the car to the dealer, no financing.  Still driving that same car and it is in great shape.  ..Oh, BTW it?s a stick.  Gotta love a manual!..SPark, i think he said 100 every 6 months...The choice doesn?t have to be between brand new car and old beater.  ..A reasonable alternative is to buy a year-old used car? it?s already taken the huge first year depreciation but has the reliability benefits that come with buying new.  Just make sure you know the car?s provenance (avoid buying a rental car which probably wasn?t well treated or well serviced, for instance)...Glad you enjoyed the ?new car smell?, Ramit, but it might not have been so good for you:..I love my Jettas. I?ve had two in the last 20 years with a Ford Bronco in between.  I bought both of them used and drove the snot out of them. I put around 175,000 miles on each. Someday I may buckle down and get a new car; but for my lifestyle and cash flow, a two or three year old car seems to hit the sweet spot...Lots of comments? wow? in just 24 hours?. seeing how this is such a debate, I thought it interesting to see an article that went along the same lines on CNNMoney:..This talks more about the ?idiots? though, with upside down loans and such...So what do you do if by either your stupidity or otherwise, you do end up in an upside down situation, like $9000 upside down, what can you do to fix that...It?s a 2004 Dodge Intrepid with 60,000 miles and I owe Like $15,500 and it books for about $6,000.  I know the easy answer is to stick it out and pay off the car, but I want to know some other ways to get rid of this thing...I have recently bought a house, so I have no equity and I can?t just sell it and buy something else...I love how this guy purports to ?teach you how to be rich? but then has to make a big point to make himself feel better about his irrational decision.  Awesome...Dude, chill out and enjoy your new car. Congratulations! Don?t get freaked out on justifying an emotional act as a financial one...Over the past few years, cars are only getting marginally better, so unlike computers there is really no point in being on the cutting edge...As mentioned several times already, the premium paid for a new car over one just a few years old cannot be justified on financial terms...That being said, irrational new  car buyers like yourself subsidize used car buyers like myself. So thanks!..P.S. pickups are a usually better choice anyway unless you have kids..Not true always for example, the 2015 Honda CR-V?s new engine comes from the Accord midsize sedan, so that is a big improvement over 2014 models...You can get the quality of a new car and the value of a used car by buying a 10,000-mile used car. You pay about 70 percent of the cost of the same new car. With the Internet, it?s crazy not to do this...I?ve managed to save up roughly $74408 in my bank account, but I?m not sure if I should buy a house or not.  Do you think the market is stable or do you think that home prices will decrease by a lot?..I just bought a .. and I love it!..this post is about looking neato in a new car. but it?s not teaching anyone to be rich...ramit, mindbogglingly brilliant (or finally someone who thinks like me!)...I bought my sister?s 1989 Civic from her for $1K, put in another $1K to bring it up to spec and have driven it for the last 5 years. I put 400+ miles/week on it and at 238K+ miles it still gets 35mpg & costs $325/year to insure. Other than tires, oil & gas I haven?t had to put another dime into it...It?s best to buy a used car, esp. one that has just passed the warranty limits. The previous owner(s) have sunk all their cash in getting it routinely serviced (to maintain the warranty) and the vehicle has depreciated significantly in the meantime...Ofcourse, you will check the service records before buying!..I recently read something I found interesting. Even if you buy a new car with cash, or 0% interest, you are still paying for that hefty new-car depreciation costs. It is generally smarter to buy a car that is a few years old instead...But hey, if you have the money and want a brand spanking new car, then go for it. Just know that you?re paying much more to have it brand new...You are not going to to keep your new car for as long as you think you are.  especially not 10 years. unless you want to pass it down within the family. Why? because unless you are a total failure in your career (which doesn?t look like it) you will become rich and buy your mercedes far sooner then you had planned...Guess people outgrow their cars sooner than they think they will?The first car after you start making some $$$ is most probably going to be new?Yea, I like the new car smell too!! The next upgrade has an 80% chance that it is a used car with extended warranty, low mileage, excellent maintenance?.Now, after kids, a decent suburbia home, a business that is doing well, I want to definitely own a brand new trendy car. Its a lifecycle in itself?..Wow.  We truly have some ?expert? auto purchasers here.  But they do make good points.  My personal preference towards new cars is to buy either off lease or 1-3 year old trade-ins and get the extended warranty.  Oh, and ALWAYS check Consumer Reports, and NEVER get anything but the three most reliable cars.  As a general rule, you can?t go wrong with Hondas or Toyotas, and Japanese are built much better than domestics.  ?Face? based society FTW!..I?ve done the analysis myself and agree with most of your points, especially when you factor in the used cost more to maintain on average (even for hondas and toyotas).  Only factor you forgot was the opportunity cost of money if you have it invested somewhere else.  I?m comparing new accord to used one and the delta is about $8000K, then if you compound the incremental delta less the resale values over life of the car for me it ended up being  its close to $11K...?Used? doesn?t have to mean ?5 years old.? I?m a big fan of 1+ years old used cars just to avoid the drive-it-off-the-lot fee, while still keeping the bulk of the value of the life of the car...Love your website!..To me, I?d never consider a used car because of one reason: I don?t trust the seller. Yes, there are many people who take care of their cars, regular maintenance and stuff. But there are many others don?t do these things. I just don?t trust anyone whom I?ve never met~..You are so right especially people who know they are not going to keep the car they bought (used/new) no where close to 10 years, they are going to do only the bear minimum maintenance so they can offload to the subsequent buyer. I am not against buying used but their high savings is not what it seems to be especially if don?t know a good mechanic. Also not all models depreciate 50% in the first or second year...silly. if you are buying a new car just for the smell, buy new car smell in a can like I do. ..This article makes no sense?.you bought a primarily for reliability?  If you look at the statistical  difference in reliability between a 3yr old used honda accord and a brand new one is marginal.  So your argument is invalid?.first and last time im reading this blog..if your worried about repair costs of a used vehicle, you can buy an aftermarket extended warranty and still save a huge percentage off new.  Lets face it, 3 years old with reasonable mileage still drives as new.  This formula provides the best value of reliability:cost.  Buying a warranty for a honda may not make as much sense as buying one for a domestic, but you see the picture.  Run the numbers and youll find cost of ownership is considerabley lower per year...Why pay Consumer Reports or the fightingchance for information that?s free? Besides pricing info at kbb, there?s so much free info at edmunds.com you can spend months there reading and getting invoice prices...when the day is done, whatever decision you make, as long as you are happy with it, that?s justification enough for me.  it?s your car and your payments to deal with.  i am confident that your new purchase isn?t running you broke, so it ties in with your article on spending $5,000 on shoes, etc.  congrats on your new car, Ramit!..My stepson sent this to me to ?prove? that new is better than used, and let me tell you, this proves NOTHING. What a ridiculous rationale to buy a new car! I remain unconvinced, and think this country should eliminate as many cars as possible. We should make our cities car-free. Cars are ugly, polluting monstrocities that are much more trouble than they are worth. Is it any wonder that Americans are in debt up to their eyeballs and obese to boot? They buy new cars every couple of years and never walk anywhere...Suzanne, I suspect it must be very frustrating to have one lens through which to view everything. This article wasn?t about keeping cars out of our cities. It was about new vs. used cars, and the fact that used cars aren?t always the ?best? choice...Zain, thanks for the nice, thoughtful comment. Yes, I still drive the Accord ? that?s the point! If you drive a car for only 2 years, you made one of the worst financial decisions you could make. The keys are: (1) Get a good car, (2) Maintain it well, and (3) Drive it for a LONG time. I hope to have this car for many, many more years...One thing I would say to those who are looking at purchasing a used car would be to make sure the car has at least some form of a warranty.  When I bought my VW Jetta (WHICH I ABSOLUTELY LOVE, BTW), I made them give me a warranty (3 months/3000 miles).  The second day I had it, the transmission effed up and the Honda dealership I bought it from (yeah, don?t ask) was forced to pay for a brand new transmission (2000+)...Ramit?if you don?t give a flip about cars one way or another (like me), what about buying one that?s a year old? Seems like you take the edge off the new car price and still get a dependable vehicle. ..Also, I liked Suzanne?s comments. Cars=fat people. I?m selling my car and cancelling my gym membership today...I totally agree with you Ramit. We have a lot of kids, so we hand-me-down cars, computers, furniture,etc.. through the ranks, especially while they are in college. But as soon as they are get that after-college ?real job?? we go with them to the new car dealer. The reliability and warranty are price-less, along with Road side assistance and other bonuses they tack on...I have to ask?why do Indian people hate coupes?..They are uncomfortable and impractical. Plus, Indians are always thinking about roaming around with 15 other Indians, which makes a 2-door car worthless. For example, think about the last time you invited an Indian person over to a houseparty. They came ? and brought their 14 closest friends...Apples to apples:  I just bought an 06 BMW 750Li used (about 2-3 years old) for 40K.  New, the same car with all the options is closer to 90K, and drives as close to new as I care about.  ..So? after saving 50K (more than 50%) of the cost of the new car for a car I fully intend to drive another 10+ years (my last one I drove for 15 years).  ..This is the only option that makes *financial* sense and I still have an awesome car...We were in the market for decent used cars over the summer. ..In our area, there was hardly any supply of decent 2-3 yr old honda/toyotas. We looked for weeks and found nothing. We widened the scope and took a look at 3 different 3-4 year old hondas at a decent dealership. Their condition was ridiculous. ..On the way out, I noticed the Honda Fit was selling new for only $1,000 ? $2,000 more. We bought the Fit and love it...Now you know TWO people who like their VW Jetta. Actually, I LOVE mine. It?s  10 years old and still running great.  Much more fun to drive than my Honda, which I also like. Lots more pick-up, too...You are so ?human? that it makes me sick...This goes well with understanding the difference of value and Price ...I bought a mobile phone at Rs 800 ($16) for my home , just to use it for days use . The value it provided my was much more than $50 i would say . ..This is a nice read on the topic : ..Manish..?And it only gets better as you drive the car longer with no payments. In other words, you save more in non-payments than the car depreciates.?..Bwahahah, please, please, stop, I can?t take any more, my sides are splitting...I don?t think ?saving money? means what you think it means...Suckers buy new cars, you didn?t find this out until after you bought yours, then you found out, then you got angry and felt stupid...That?s why this article exists...We should point out that the person who leased has escaped the repair and maintenance costs that car owners typically encounter with aging cars. Meanwhile, the car buyer has to pay for routine maintenance, which is usually just oil changes and tire rotation, as well as paying at least for new tires and brakes, which would cost about $1,000...Yes, yes. You bought a new car because you are in your 20?s. I know, I know. We all have been young and stupid and have had our asses totally owned. We wanted a excuse to look good when we knew no other way to do so. Wait till you learn finance and look back in your older years!..People give this garbage ?peace of mind? excuse all the time. This is ridiculous. If spending more money gives you peace of mind then your mind is messed up. For any rational person, it would be silly to pay more money for something when it adds absolutely no value. Buying new doesn?t give you more value. In fact, looking at it from any angle shows that buying new destroys value. If you want a new car, lease it. That?s the cheaper option, but still a bad decision versus buying used...However examining lawyers do occasionally change..their minds. That took place in an instance including the team Dykes on Bikes...Paragraph writing is also a fun, if you know after that you can write or else it is..difficult to write...Howdy!

Apple Car: Everything you need to know
http://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-car-news-rumours-driverless-price-release-date-electric

(Update: 12 September 2016): Want to know everything about the rumoured Apple Car? Here?s what we know so far, including the expected Apple Car price, release date, design, leaks, and whether or not it?s driverless and electric.

Trending:..by .. ..The Apple Car is a tricky subject because we?re not even sure that it exists. Nevertheless, few products have been rumoured as heavily ? and debated so vociferously ? as the Apple Car. Tesla CEO Elon Musk is already calling the car a "missed opportunity" due to its far-off launch. There's no denying that the evidence of an Apple Car is mounting, and it seems Apple is struggling to keep a lid on leaks...The long-rumoured electric vehicle ? supposedly developer under the codename ?Project Titan? ? is tipped for either a 2019 or 2020 launch. It?s also alleged that Apple is developing the vehicle in Berlin (in part, anyway), with a team of between 15 and 20 ?progressive thinkers? ? so says the German media. The Cupertino-based technology giant is also reportedly in talks with manufacturers of charging stations for electric cars...In any case, ... The Apple CarPlay in-car ecosystem has been a long-standing part of Apple's portfolio, and the company was recently awarded a patent that described how a car could be controlled, in part, by an iPhone. So with the innards of a car already cracked, Apple's movement into vehicle manufacturing wouldn't be a huge surprise...The actual design of the vehicle is still up for debate. Some say it will be a car, others a minivan. Some say it will be driverless, others electric ? maybe both. Apple was recently reported to be interested in autonomous vehicle testing facilities, which suggests that the former may certainly be true...What we do know is that Apple certainly has the resources to build an electric car. Even a senior Ford exec admitted to .. that he thinks Apple ?can do it?. After all, the company has a world-leading market capitalisation of $524 billion, and has over $200 billion cash in the bank. Tesla started with far less...But is there any evidence to suggest that Apple is building an Apple Car? And if such a vehicle exists, what will it look like?.. .. .. ..Vague concepts of an "iCar" have been spun for an age, but we?re all about hard evidence here at ... To that end, we?ve rounded up all the apparent "proof" for the existence of an Apple Car...On 12 February 2015, Bryan Chaffin, co-founder of The Mac Observer, told Business Insider that ... Chaffin said:..?What I learned is that Apple has been looking for ? and acquiring ? the kind of people from Tesla with expertise that is most suited to cars. So much so that I went from being a doubter to a believer almost instantly. From another source who travels in more rarified circles than yours truly, I also learned that a lot of people at the top in Silicon Valley consider it a given that Apple is working on a car.?..He then added that he was close ?to 100%? certain that Apple was attempting to build a car for the consumer market...On 13 February 2015, the Wall Street Journal noted the existence of ... The project was reported to entail an electric vehicle ?that resembles a minivan?...At the time, it was claimed that Apple was still in the vehicle design stage. The piece read:.."The size of the project team and the senior people involved indicate that the company is serious. Apple executives have flown to Austria to meet with contract manufacturers for high-end cars, including the Magna Steyr unit of Canadian auto supplier Magna International Inc.?..The WSJ went on to say that Apple ?hopes to put its stamp on the electric vehicle market in the same way it did the smartphone with its iPhone?, and that the firm had given the go ahead for the creation of a 1,000-person team, and permitted poaching from different parts of the company...On 20 February 2015, a Bloomberg report alleged that ... The article claimed that the company was working to a five-year time frame, which would put the release in the year 2020...On 13 March 2015, AppleInsider published an extensive report detailing the .....The article cited ?two people familiar with knowledge of the project?, suggesting that Apple is making use of its leased Sunnyvale, California campus to build the car...The website writes:..?According to one AppleInsider source familiar with ?Titan?, many of Apple?s new auto-related hires, including recruits from Tesla, have been working out of the Sunnyvale campus. This person claims that some of the projects underway have been kept ?very secret within the company?.?..But Apple couldn?t openly develop a car right in front of everyone?s eyes, could it? Well that same AppleInsider report makes mention of a company "SixtyEight Research", which it suggested may be a shell company being used by Apple to work on the car...According to the company website, SixtyEight Research is a self-proclaimed "innovative company" that's "redefining market research". It?s based at the Sunnyvale campus. What?s particularly interesting about SixtyEight Research is that it has almost no presence online, and no-one really knows what the company actually does. The report explains:..?SixtyEight?s affiliation could not be confirmed, but Apple does have a long history of using shell corporations and deceptive methods to hide its secret projects. Aside from a barren website, there is scant other information about SixtyEight ? lending more credence to its use as a front. It wouldn?t be a stretch to surmise that SixtyEight could play a role in allowing Apple to purchase and import automotive equipment and tools without drawing any suspicion.?..The article also details how employees approach the site with Apple badges that have been "scrubbed" of the official Apple branding. What?s more, certain buildings on the site have been given permits for automotive work and repair areas. Unfortunately, we still don?t know exactly what Apple is cooking up at the Sunnyvale Campus, and the company has declined to provide official comment on the matter...On 27 May  2015, .. that the company may be eyeing the automotive industry...When quizzed about Apple?s oft-rumoured interest in building an electric car, Williams responded: ?The car is the ultimate mobile device.? He also said that Apple is ?exploring a lot of different markets?, and that the company hopes to enter industries ?where we think we can make a huge amount of difference?...On 1 August 2015, a Reuters article noted that several senior .. over the past year...The report cited ?two sources familiar? with the matter, and revealed that Apple CEO Tim Cook visited BMW?s headquarters last year. It also claimed that ?senior Apple executives? toured BMW?s Leipzig factory to ?learn how it manufactures the i3 electric car?...?The dialogue ended without conclusion, because Apple appears to want to explore developing a passenger car on its own,? the report explains, and suggests that BMW was ?cautious? about sharing ?manufacturing know-how? with Apple because it doesn?t want to end up as a ?mere supplier?...Apple executives reportedly probed BMW board members on tooling, production and parts licensing. A senior BMW source was quoted as saying: ?Apple executives were impressed with the fact that we abandoned traditional approaches to car-making and started afresh. It chimed with the way they do things too.?..On 14 August 2015, The Guardian detailed an apparent attempt by Apple to secure a ... The publication obtained documents that proved correspondence between Apple and a potential test site. The report claimed that Apple had scouted a 2,100-acre former Naval base ? 40 miles from Silicon Valley ? which is now a facility for testing driverless cars...According to the report, Apple?s Special Projects team visited the GoMentum Station in May, with talks still ongoing. In one correspondence, Apple engineer Frank Fearon is alleged to have written:..?We would...like to get an understanding of timing and availability for the space, and how we would need to coordinate around other parties who will be using [it].?..Jack Hall, GoMentum Station program manager, reportedly responded:..?We would still like to meet in order to keep everything moving and to meet your testing schedule.?..The station ? which has been used by both Mercedes-Benz and Honda for autonomous vehicle testing ? is currently bound to a non-disclosure agreement with Apple regarding discussions...On 18 September 2015, The Guardian released another report that suggested .. with California?s Department of Motor Vehicles...The article ? based on documents related to the matter ? revealed that Mike Maletic, a senior legal counsel at Apple ? had an ?hour-long meeting? with Bernard Soriano, DMV deputy director, and Stephanie Dougherty, chief of strategic planning, on 17 August. These individuals are the DMV?s self-driving car experts, and co-sponsors of California?s autonomous vehicle regulation project. Also alleged to have attended the meeting is Brian Soublet, deputy director and chief counsel of the DMV...According to the report, the DMV didn?t disclose the details of what was discussed at the meeting, only stating: ?The Apple meeting was to review [the] DMV?s autonomous vehicle regulations.?..We already know that California?s DMV is currently working on regulations to control the eventual public rollout of self-driving vehicles. If Apple is plotting an electric vehicle, it will need to adhere to these regulations to operate on Californian roads...On 21 September 21 2015, the Wall Street Journal claimed that ... According to the report, Apple is tripling its 600-strong workforce at its secret automotive facility...It?s alleged that the company has a planned shipment date of 2019, and that Apple is ?accelerating efforts? to meet its deadline...On 19 October 2015, Apple CEO ... Speaking at the WSJDLive conference in California, Cook said:..?It would seem like there will be massive change in that industry, massive change. You may not agree with that. That?s what I think.?..Unfortunately, Cook stopped short of saying whether Apple would be directly involved with this change. And of course, much of the speculation about the Apple Car is based on employees hired by Apple, which we?ll detail in the next section...On 6 November 2015, the New York Post published a profile of .....The Californian firm, which began its operations last year, is currently building a ?billion-dollar manufacturing plant? and ?poaching the best minds in the auto world?, according to the report. The Post notes that the company acquired its funding in a peculiarly short space of time. What?s more, the company currently has upwards of 400 employees, and aims to increase that to 500 by the end of the year. That?s impressive scaling for a year-old company with no existing products to its name...Faraday Future is also keeping the identity of its CEO quiet. Instead, Nick Sampson, former director of vehicle and chassis engineering at Tesla, who now works as Senior VP for the firm, handles public correspondence...?..,? says Sampson, who has declined to reveal Faraday Future?s partners...The Post suggests that Faraday Future may actually be a front for Apple, to develop its secret car project in plain sight. Sampson previously told reporters that the company was aiming to launch a brand-new electric car that would rival the Tesla Model S. However, the company is aiming to launch the vehicle in 2017, two years earlier than Apple was rumoured to release its own car...Unfortunately, there's no concrete evidence that links Faraday Future to Apple, so take this report with caution...On 16 December 2015, a report by Silicon Republic speculated on a possible ploy by Apple to build the Apple Car in Ireland. The report noted a recruitment drive by Apple, specifically targeting auto industry experts to work at its plant in Cork...One recent job post included a "Global Supplier Manager" position with experience in the automotive industry. Another advertised for a "Procurement Manager" with experience in "automotive design". The job description explained that Apple was seeking applicants who could "achieve most efficient costs for equipment while helping enable Apple's unique design and testing requirements"...Tim Cook also recently took a trip to Ireland to meet with Apple employees, pledging 1,000 new jobs for the Cork plant, which is currently staffed by a 5,000-strong workforce. Of course, we can't say for sure what Apple is planning for the Cork plant until more evidence comes to light...On January 8, 2016, it became apparent ? courtesy of .. ? that Apple had registered three car-related domains, hinting at the as yet unconfirmed Apple Car project...The domains in question were:..Of course, there's no guarantee that these domain registrations mean Apple is working on an automotive project. Companies often buy out ? and sit on ? domains simply to prevent rival entities scooping them up ahead of time...It's also worth noting that the domains could be related to the Apple CarPlay connectivity system, which is a publicly available product...On January 12, 2016, Elon Musk, the man behind Tesla, SpaceX, and Paypal, .. the Apple Car as "obvious", and "an open secret"...Musk made the comments in an interview with the BBC, during which he revealed he believes Apple would "probably make a compelling electic car", and that "it seems like an obvious thing to do". The Tesla boss also said that "it's pretty hard to hide something if you hire a thousand engineers to do it"...On February 22, 2016, Tim Cook spoke to .. about the company's explorations in the automotive sector..."... So I can't talk about this certain area that you're talking about. But when we start spending large amounts of money, we're committed at that point. But we explore things with teams of people."..He continued: "Part of exploring technologies and picking the right one is becoming so familiar with it you can see ways that it can be used. And for us, we've never been about being first. So we explore many different things, many different technologies. And at first we might not know what product it might wind up in."..On February 26, 2016, Cook talked about prospects of an Apple Car yet again, this time at Apple's annual shareholder meeting, courtesy of ....."Do you remember when you were a kid and Christmas Eve was so exciting? You weren't sure what was going on downstairs? Well, it's going to be Christmas Eve for a while."..Not so helpful, Tim...On April 19, 2016, a period of quiet in Apple Car rumour-dom came to an end with a report from a German newspaper claiming the vehicle was in development in Berlin. According to Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Apple .. between 15 and 20 automotive experts at a "secret lab" in the German capital...The report cites the workers as having experience in engineering, manufacturing, software, and sales, and describes them as "progressive thinkers". The same article alleged that Apple is considering using Austrian-based Magna Steyr ? an automotive manufacturer ? to build the Apple Car...Magna Steyr is a subsidiary of Magna International, and is headquartered in Graz, Austria. It was founded in 2001, and has around 10,500 employees. The company builds around 200,000 vehicles a year, and developed Mercedes-Benz's '4Matic' four-wheel drive system. It also develops cars on behalf of manufacturers like BMW, Audi, Fiat, Peugeot, and Aston Martin...On May 6, 2016, the Wall Street Journal claimed Apple was eyeing up a huge property in California to test out its secretive driverless Apple Car project...The report cited a "top landlord" in the area ? Victor Coleman, CEO of Hudson Pacific Properties ? who reportedly said:.."We're seeing the Toyotas of the world, the Teslas of the world, BMWs, Mercedes. Ford now is out in the marketplace looking for space. I haven't even mentioned the 400,000 square feet that Google's looking to take down and the 800,000 square feet that Apple's looking to take down for their autonomous cars as well."..Hudson Pacific is a major landlord in the San Francisco Bay Area, and already rents properties to tech giants like Uber and Square. According to the WSJ, Coleman described driverless vehicle testing facilities as a "hot demand item", and said that there is a "definitive movement" from Silicon Valley companies in the space...On May 24, 2016, it was revealed that the US Patent and Trademark office had awarded a patent that allowed a vehicle to be controlled using a portable device, like an iPhone or iPad. The patent describes how the device could unlock the car doors or even start the engine, and also allows for multiple devices to control the car at any one time. Here are some of the operations Apple reveals the iPhone could perform:..This is, of course, not necessarily evidence of an Apple Car. However, it does signal Apple's continued efforts in the vehicle space, and shows that Apple has plenty to offer in terms of innovation. Getting third-party car manufacturers to sign up to this wide-reaching ecosystem will surely be on Apple's agenda, although an Apple Car would likely debut with all of this technology built in anyway...On May 25, 2016, an exclusive Reuters .. claimed that Apple has been speaking to manufacturers of charging stations for electric cars. The report claims .. based on a review of LinkedIn profiles. However, the report says that the companies approached by Apple are reluctant to share knowledge with a potential competitor...The sources cited in the report were unclear about whether Apple hoped to build its own charging stations, or simply engineer compatibility with existing systems. Apple declined to comment on the story, but the president of NRG Energy's EVgo charging business said he was "in discussions with every manufacturer of today and every potential manufacturer of tomorrow". That's not exactly a denial, is it?..Speaking to Reuters, an anonymous source said: "It would be natural to assume if Apple is going to have a fully battery electric vehicle that creates a seamless consumer experience the way Apple does, the charging infrastructure and its availability would be of paramount importance."..On June 16, 2016, Bloomberg reported on possible evidence of Apple's interest in the automotive sector. According to the article, Canadian auto-parts maker Linamar Corp. has talked with both Apple and Google about potentially supplying vehicle components. During an interview in Toronto, CEO Linda Hasenfratz decline to go into detail on the matter, but said:..".. as well because obviously we've got the experience and we know what we need to do in order to build a high-quality vehicle. We're quoting work and designing products that could be utilised in those vehicles."..Apple didn't immediately respond to Bloomberg's request for comment, so we should take this report with due caution for now...On July 13, 2016, Formula 1 blogger Joe Saward suggested that Apple may be involved in purchasing the Formula 1...Apple hasn't really got a history of high-profile acquisitions, usually opting to snap up smaller companies and integrate them into the firm's existing structure. An F1 buy would be a different proposition altogether, but it's actually not that crazy. For one, it's no secret that Formula 1 is up for sale ? the group has been publicly looking for a buyer since 2015, with supremo Bernie Ecclestone saying he's 'ready' to sell the financially struggling series...There's even been a price attached to the wildly popular racing championship: $8.5 billion (around ?6 billion). It was previously thought that the buyer would be a US-Qatari consortium led by Qatar Sports Investments, best known as the ultra-rich owners of French Ligue 1 football outfit Paris Saint-German. However, Saward says that Apple could also be throwing in its lot at the last minute:.."There are whispers from Princes Gate, home of the Formula One group, that there is another round of intensive due diligence going on, which suggests that there is another serious bidder emerging. .., which is a company with $161 billion in net cash at the moment."..A Formula 1 buyout isn't evidence of an Apple Car, but it offers some decent crossover. As well as acquiring a high-profile platform to promote the Apple Car, it would also take on the organisation's strong relationships with premium car makers like Ferrari, Williams, and McClaren. Even more interestingly, as the owner of F1, Apple would be catapulted into a seat at the table with governing body FIA, which also oversees the burgeoning Formula E electric car racing series...Plus, Formula 1 is one of the most-watched sports in the world, so exclusive streaming rights would be a huge boon for Apple TV...On July 21, 2016, a new report by The Information claimed that the Apple Car won't be available until 2021. The article describes how Apple has pushed back its internal target of 2020 by a whole year. The report reads:.."One person who worked briefly with the Titan team was told during their tenure at Apple that the company had been trying to deliver a vehicle by 2020 but the target slipped to 2021."..On July 25, 2016, a new WSJ report claimed that Apple had appointed a former top exec to head up its Apple Car project. Bob Mansfield, a former Senior Vice President at Apple, is now in charge of Project Titan, according to "people familiar with the matter". The report noted:.."Earlier this month, employees at Apple noticed in the company directory that all the senior managers on the car project were now reporting to Mr Mansfield."..Bob Mansfield is a hardware engineer who was previously Senior Vice President of Technologies. He joined Apple in 1999 and worked as a top executive under the late CEO Steve Jobs. Mansfield left the executive team in 2013 to work on "special projects under CEO Tim Cook"...Mansfield's recent career has been shrouded in mystery, with the former executive having reportedly supervised the development of the Apple Watch and smart television products. He also led the teams that developed the MacBook Air, the iMac, and the iPad...On July 28, 2016, a Bloomberg report claimed that Apple is placing "increased emphasis" on developing self-driving technology, citing people familiar with the project...The report says that Apple has hired Dan Dodge, the former head of BlackBerry's automotive software division, to help lead this new push. Dodge is reportedly part of a team headed up by Bob Mansfield, who recently took over leadership of the Project Titan initiative. Bloomberg also makes clear that Apple is "not abandoning efforts to design its own vehicle", and that the company wants to leave options open regarding building its own Apple Car or partnering/acquiring an established car maker...On August 9, 2016, Korean news site ETnews reported that Apple had tapped a Korean battery company to help develop batteries for the Apple Car. These batteries would, apparently, feature patented hollow battery technology, although the report declined to name the company in question...A follow-up article by MacRumors alleged that the company in question may be Orange Power, a Korean company that has filed a patent application for hollow-type secondary batteries, and has 33 employees...However, none of the information contained in either report has been confirmed...On September 9, 2016, the New York Times reported that Apple had sacked "dozens" of employees working on the Apple Car...According to the report, Apple is rethinking its plans for self-driving cars, shuttering parts of the project and even laying off employees. That's according to three different sources that were brief on the decision, but who were not able to comment on the matter publicly...The report suggests that Apple veteran Bob Mansfield, who took the helm on 'Project Titan' back in July, has shifted the focus of the project, moving from developing a car to "building out the underlying technology for an autonomous vehicle". The new layoffs are said to be a part of this Project Titan "reboot" ? the total workforce is estimated at around 1,000 employees, for reference...The company has been on quite the hiring spree, specifically recruiting individuals with experience in vehicles (particularly electric), .., and materials research. In fact, .. has been so prolific that a number of companies ? notably .. and .. ? have spoken out against the tech giant...Not surprisingly, Tesla has been a particular focus of Apple?s aggressive hiring regime...When asked if Tesla was concerned about Apple?s poaching of its important engineers, company founder Elon Musk responded:..?Important engineers? They have hired people we?ve fired. We always jokingly call Apple the ?Tesla Graveyard?. If you don?t make it at Tesla, you go work at Apple. I?m not kidding.?..However, .. on his comments, tweeting the following:..But do we have any idea who specifically might be working on the Apple Car? .. has compiled a list of individuals that may be involved with the project:..It?s clear from the list that Apple has pumped considerable resources into attracting people whose experience could be useful in the development of an electric vehicle. Of course, this still isn't definitive proof; Apple could be utilising these individuals? skills for any number of tangential purposes...On January 22, it emerged that Steve Zadesky ? who headed up Project Titan since its 2014 inception ? was leaving Apple for 'personal reasons', as first reported by the Wall Street Journal. Zadesky had worked at Apple for 16 years, and led the Apple Car project for two years; prior to that, he worked as an engineer at Ford Motor Co...And on July 25, the Wall Street Journal reported that former Apple SVP Bob Mansfield had been moved to a new position from which he now oversees the development of Project Titan. Employees at the company reportedly noticed that "all senior managers" now report to Mansfield...In spite of how vague the rumours about the Apple Car have been thus far, most sources seem to agree on a launch time frame. While we don?t have an exact date, the general consensus is that the Apple Car release is set for 2019 or 2020...Apple investor tycoon .. says Apple is eyeing 2020, which is echoed by ... The Wall Street Journal, meanwhile, reported earlier this year that the .. ? that?s 2019. That might seem far off, and so it should; developing a vehicle is no mean feat. That?s especially true for Apple, a company that is ? aside from CarPlay ? entirely green to the automotive industry...But is it already too late for Apple to enter the car business? According to Tesla's Elon Musk, the Apple Car is a "missed opportunity". Speaking during an .. at the Code Conference in California, Musk said:.."I think they should have embarked on this project sooner. I don't think they'll be in production sooner until 2020. It's just a missed opportunity. It's a couple years...they'll make a good car and be successful."..However, he added: "I think it's great they're doing this, and I hope it works out."..Apple has money by the truck-load, but that's no guarantee that the Apple Car will be a successful venture, right?..In fact, a number of industry executives have already .., including former GM and BMW exec Bob Lutz:..?If I were a shareholder I?d be very upset, because they?re currently engaged in a very high-margin business and the automobile business, at best, is a very low-margin business. And you can?t show me one company in the world that, to date, has made a nickel on electric cars. There is absolutely no reason to assume that Apple is going to be financially successful in the electric car business.?..The damning verdict continued:..?When it comes to actually making cars, there is no reason to assume that Apple, with no experience, will suddenly do a better job than General Motors, Ford, Volkswagen, Toyota, or Hyundai. So I think this is going to be a gigantic money pit, but then it doesn?t matter. I mean Apple has an embarrassment of riches, they don?t know where to put the cash anymore. So if they burn 30 or 40 billion dollars in the car business, no one?s going to notice.?..He added: ?If I were a board member of Apple, I?d ask some serious questions about this thing.?..Lutz isn't the only one to cast doubts about the technology industry's ability to develop a quality autonomous EV by 2020. Speaking to .., .. that self-driving cars are "at least 15 years or so away", specifically citing Google's plan for self-driving cars by 2020..."I think 2020 is unrealistic, at least not on very road. Maybe in their environment in their city, but not on every road," Andreas Meyer, a Ford development engineers, told us...We also spoke to .., who cast doubts on Apple's ability to turn out a car very quickly. In an interview with .. at CES 2016 in Las Vegas, Dave Anderson, Senior Manager of Automotive Integration at Nvidia, described how building vehicles is a challenging process, even for Apple...?.., and even with a company that?s as sophisticated as Apple ? and Google ? that process still takes time,? he explained...However, Anderson described how technology companies like Apple ? which have a longstanding history in computing systems ? have a good shot at overtaking traditional vendors...?There is somewhat of an advantage initially, and you could see [Ford] supplanted by very motivated companies, like Tesla,? he continued. ?Literally with that dedication and that motivation, [Elon Musk] created a car company within about ten years. But again, it?s ten years.?..Nvidia currently builds computing systems for cars, and is developing technology for a self-driving future...The firm, best known for its graphics cards, has a number of partners in the car space, including Audi, BMW, and Daimler. But despite these doubts, all things point to Apple trundling along towards its 2020 launch window...A surprising proponent of the long-rumoured .., as revealed during an exclusive interview with Don Butler, Executive Director for Connected Vehicles and Services at the company, speaking to .. at CES 2016. Butler said he believes both Apple and Google can create successful car franchises, and is excited to see competitors join the industry..."We welcome othes joining. We welcome the activity that's in the space. We think it's exciting. It's actually changed that we are embracing," Butler told us. "So I think Apple can do it. I think Google can do it."..Ford's connected vehicles lead continued: "I think that what you will most likely see is a number of partnerships with companies that bring different skill-sets to the table working together to deliver solutions that neither of them could have done possibly on their own."..Butler also told us he thinks fully .., which gels with Apple's much-mooted 2019/2020 timeline...And in April, the CEO of Ford revealed that the car-maker has a "working assumption" that Apple is building an Apple Car, during an interview with the BBC. Mark Fields said that he really has "no idea" whether Apple is creating a car:.."... Our working assumption is that they are, and that again provides us the right motivation to make sure that we stay very focused, not only on the product, but overall on the experience that the customer has.".."There's a lot of traditional competitors that we have in our business who we know and respect," the Ford CEO explained. "There's a lot of new non-traditional competitors, who are looking at the automotive space and looking at that addressable market and saying 'Gee, can we get a piece of that?'"..He added: "From our standpoint, we're looking at a number of the technological changes in the industry, and we're viewing that as an opportunity, not as a threat."..Right, so there?s plenty of evidence that Apple might be building a car, but what would such a vehicle look like?..Well we already know that Apple has a penchant for slick minimalism, an aesthetic that?s maintained across all of its products. Unfortunately, all things point to Apple still being in the design phase for the Apple Car, so it?s unlikely that the finer details will have been finalised yet...Our best clue yet is the WSJ mentioned earlier ? dated 13 February ? that claims Apple ?is working on the design of a vehicle that resembles a mini-van?...What does that tell us? It tells us that the Apple Car, at least in early design stages, will be big enough to carry at least five people. It also tells us that Apple might not be eyeing direct competition with the BMW i8 electric supercar...In terms of colour, there?s no information in the ether as yet ? but we can take a guess. While Apple products of sported a host of paintjobs in the past, it has recently tended towards a select few hues. We?re talking about black, white, champagne, rose gold, silver, and space grey ? core colours for contemporary Apple fare, and all in with a chance of being splashed across the chassis of an Apple Car...Jean Louis-Gassee, a former Apple executive writing for the .., explains that Apple may just offer a single colour option..."Just as Apple managed to get much higher iPod margins than competing makers, can the Cupertino company do better than Toyota or Ford?" he writes. "One way Apple could simplify the path to profits would be to offer a single model in a single colour (rose gold maybe; white, more likely)."..On January 5, 2016, an Argentinian designer Matias Papalini has revealed his vision for the ... The images show what look to be a detachable steering wheel with a large ? and probably touch-sensitive ? display running the length of the dashboard...With Apple playing its cards close to its chest however, we?ll be in the dark about the Apple Car design for quite some time...Two of the most commonly asked questions about the Apple Car are whether it will be (1) electric, and (2) driverless. Let?s tackle these one at a time...For the former, we?d have to say yes, the Apple Car ? should it exist ? will almost certainly be electric. For a start, the majority of Apple?s auto-industry hires have at least some experience with electric vehicles. That?s evident from the aggressive acquisition of Tesla staff, a company that?s built its name off the back of electric cars. It?s also clear that the industry is now tending towards electric cars; tech magnate Sir Richard Branson has even predicted that there will be no ?diesel or petrol internal combustion engines anywhere in the world? by 2020...So if the future of cars is electric, and Apple is building a car for the future, it makes sense that the vehicle should be electric. And that?s not forgetting the persistent Apple Car leaks, all of which agree that the Apple Car will be electric. But the question of whether the Apple Car will be driverless is a little tougher to answer. While electric cars have certainly come to the fore, driverless vehicles still attract plenty of scepticism...That?s because while autonomous vehicles might sound great on paper, putting cars on the road without an actual human behind the wheel is very difficult to roll out in practice...?No one is going to want to realise autonomous driving into the world until there?s proof that it?s much safer, like a factor of 100 safer, than having a human drive,? said Andrew Moore, dean of computer science at Carnegie Mellon, speaking to The Atlantic...Moore continued: ?...?..Our best guess is that if Apple wants to hit its rumoured 2020 deadline, it will need to focus on electric cars initially...To create a driverless vehicle will require a significant amount of development, and not just on the part of Apple; our governments still have to develop road infrastructure and legislation to the point where autonomous cars can be realistically used in public...That said, there's some evidence that Apple has been working on autonomous driving. Take, for instance, The Guardian report from 14 August that claims Apple is eyeing a testing ground for autonomous vehicles at a former naval base. Or The Guardian?s 18 September report that revealed Apple met with California?s DMV for discussions with driverless car experts...So whether or not Apple is developing an autonomous Apple Car, it appears that the company has, at least, shown some interest in driverless technology...Let?s say Apple is working on an electric vehicle ? how much will it set you back? If previous Apple products are anything to go by, it?s likely that the Apple Car won?t come cheap...Well according to technology analysts at Jefferies and Co, the ... That?s an estimated price, which the analysts claim represents an average across several Apple Car variants, detailed in a 68-page report. That might sound expensive ? the BMW i3 starts at $42,400 ? but the Apple Car isn?t expected to go on sale for a long time, in a future market that will inevitably demand higher mark-ups...Jefferies and Co also predicted that Apple will sell at least 200,000 units of its very first vehicle. That?s a sizeable figure, especially as Tesla is expected to sell just 55,000 cars in 2015. Realistically, though, we have no idea how much the Apple Car will cost until Apple gets up on stage and reveals the figure to the world ? if such a day ever comes...            ..            ..            ..            ..            ..            ..The driverless car market is a subscription market. iTunes for transportation. People buy cars to drive them - if you take away the romance of being at the wheel then you might as well use Uber.

s acceptance of smaller, turbocharged engines became a reality with the introduction of the .. and .. .. But the company, it appears, isn?t ready to say goodbye to its naturally-aspirated V-12 engines as a new report from German magazine .. claims that the successor to the .. will continue to use 12 cylinders...The yet-to-be-named model is due to arrive sometime in 2019 with an upgraded version of the 6.3-liter V-12 engine that?s currently being used by the .. So don?t expect any turbochargers with the F12?s successor because you won?t see any. That said, previous reports have indicated that the V-12 engine may not be the only power source that will be provided for the new model. So while the old school V-12 is still being used, a modern form of assistance is likely needed to get the car?s power output to a place where Ferrari wants it to be. That ?assistance? could come in the form of a .. system made up of an upgraded version of the V-12 and a few .. motors...It?s not that much of a stretch to consider given how little wiggle room the company has in giving the new model more power than the 770-horsepower .. but less than the 963-horsepower .. hypercar. An output somewhere in the neighborhood of 800 horsepower is the presumed objective for the new model, and given how much Ferrari has already squeezed out of the V-12 to get to the output of the F12tdf, it could bring in a those electric motors into the fold to help get to that ?next level? output it wants for the F12?s successor...Not surprisingly, Ferrari has yet to comment on these reports and don?t expect any confirmations anytime soon. The Prancing Horse has been traditionally tight-lipped when it comes to future models, especially those in the upper echelons of its lineup... crashes are nothing new so those that make the news are usually the ones that have a rich story to tell. Consider then the absurdity of this .. that damaged two ..s in Lijiang, China. According to reports from the Chinese media, the two Ferraris figured into the crash when one of the drivers abruptly hit his brakes to avoid a dog crossing the road...Things took a turn for the worse when the driver of the second 488 slammed into the rear of the first .. before crashing into a guardrail. Both cars were heavily damaged as a result of the crash, although fortunately, neither the two drivers nor the dog that crossed the road were just from the whole ordeal...Local authorities immediately arrived on the scene and discovered that both .. had their license plates covered, which raised suspicions that both drivers either covered them up to keep them from being identified or that they were actually racing when the crash occurred. The severity of the damage does indicate that the second Ferrari wasn?t meekly following the first when it crashed, but was actually traveling at a high speed when it slammed into the back of the first Ferrari...In any event, both drivers have a lot of explaining to do when they send the heavily damaged 488s for repair. Judging by how both look in the aftermath of the crash, both cars are going to need significant repairs, which translates to a lot of money out of the pockets of the two drivers...The ..s total production count will push to exactly 500 units after the Italian automaker announced plans to build a final unit of the .. in response to the recent earthquake that devastated Central Italy on August 24... chairman and CEO Sergio Marchionne made the announcement in the company?s headquarters in Maranello. According to Marchionne, the final example of the .. will be auctioned off at an unspecified time and place. The proceeds from that .. will go directly towards assisting the victims of the 6.2-magnitude earthquake, which killed close to 250 people...Details about the ?final edition? LaFerrari are still being kept under wraps, but for the most part, expect it to carry the same features as the 499 units before it, including the .. that puts out 963 horsepower and 663 pound-feet of torque. A few identifiers could also be put in place to signify its uniqueness, although given the significance of such a model, Ferrari could auction off the 500th LaFerrari in stock form and it still would sell a lot more than the car?s $1.3 million price tag...There is a precedent for that belief. Something similar occurred last decade when the Italian automaker built a 400th unit of the .. for Pope John Paul II back in 2005. Instead of taking delivery of the car, the then-pontiff and now Saint John Paul the Great, opted to auction off the .. .. to benefit victims of the tsunami that rocked South Asia in 2004. The winner ended up paying more than $1 million for the car, which has since been auctioned off again, most recently in Mexico in 2015 where it fetched $6.05 million... built the Monza between 1953 and 1957, producing one of the world?s top collector cars in the process. In that timespan, this open-top .. collected a wide variety of trophies and accolades, offering up impressive capabilities for any driver willing to tame it. The 750 variant of the Monza dropped in 1954, making its competition debut at the Italian racetrack from which it draws its name. The model is also important because it marks the transitional period from the Colombo V-12 to the Lampredi four-cylinder engine, the latter of which would play an integral role in Ferrari?s competition history...However, some 750 Monzas are considered more desirable than others, and this particular vehicle you see pictured here is one such example. It was recently put on the block at the RM Sotheby?s .. in Monterey, trading hands for well over $5 million...Why so expensive? For starters, this car came from the personal collection of the great American race car driver Jim Hall, who had the car in his possession for 60 years before it was auctioned off. This example also won a slew of races at the hands of legends like Carroll Shelby and Phil Hill, and it arrived in Monterey in a pristine, unmodified condition...Long story short, this is quite likely the most desirable Ferrari 750 Monza in the world. Read on for all the details...We may be in the dog days of summer, but for a perennially busy aftermarket tuner like .. no amount of idle time can make up for creating a tuning program for one of the market?s newest .. the ... That?s exactly what the German tuner did, doing so only two months after unveiling a similar kit for the ... Much like the earlier program, Novitec Rosso?s work on the .. revolves around an engine upgrade that puts some extra muscle to the ..s 3.9-liter twin-turbo V-8 engine, resulting in a new output of 772 horsepower and 658 pound-feet of torque...The numbers are identical to what the tuner was able to get out of the .. version. Rest assured though, the effects are far different, both from a performance standpoint and from a wind-blowing-your-hair point-of-view. Better yet, the enhancements don?t just end with the engine upgrades. It wouldn?t be a Novitec Rosso tuning kit if it was strictly limited to that. The German tuner is also known for its carbon fiber aero bits and without disappointment, Novitec is also offering a full aerodynamic body kit that?s even been subjected to strenuous wind tunnel testing...As expected, a new set of wheels is also part of the program and an interior upgrade that?s largely left to the whims and financial might of the customer. In other words, this tuning kit for the Ferrari 488 GTS is a trademark Novitec Rosso program, complete with all the bells and whistles that have come to define the well-established aftermarket company...When it comes to major .. it?s pretty common to find various .. models at the top of the list. This year, the auctions taking place during Monterey Car Week were wild as usual. .. auctions turned out some amazing vehicles with the .. pulling in nearly $20 million, but that?s nowhere near the kind of numbers we saw at the .. auction. In fact, Gooding?s number for the top five cars was more than double that of Mecum?s top 10 ? pretty wild right?..Gooding had a lot of cars listed, and 160 of those lots actually sold. Some of the lower-priced cars include models like a 1954 Alfa Romeo 1900 C Coupe for $412,500, a 1988 Porsche 959 Comfort for $1,320,000, a 1954 Austin-Healey 100/4 BN1 Le Mans for $143,000, a 1928 Morris Oxford for just $49,400, and there was even a 1968 .. Grifo 7 Litri that sold for $682,000. Okay, so some of those numbers might night be ?low? for some of us, but in the grand scheme of things, none of them are much when you consider the most expensive car sold at Gooding this year commanded just of $18 million. More about that later, but I?ll give you a hint: It?s a Ferrari. Shocker, right?..Well, with that said, let?s take a good look at Gooding?s top five from this year at Monterey and talk a little about them. There?s just something about these high-dollar collectibles that really gets the blood flowing, isn?t there?..When you?re trying to sell off a .. specifically one of four in a specific color, the last thing you want is for it to start smoking as it rolls up to the .. pad. But, that?s exactly what happened to the model you?re about to see in the video above. Most likely it isn?t anything incredibly serious ? at least nothing electrical anyway. It?s likely the clutch burning up a little, which is what happens and somewhat common when you don?t know how to handle or drive an automated manual transmission like that found in the ..Ultimately, the car appears to be okay. It was pushed the rest of the way to the auction block, where it sold for a decent $2.15 million despite the troublesome smoke signals shooting from the engine cover. The car was even able to leave the auction site under its own power, as you see it carefully pull away at the end of the .. For what it?s worth, this is a video that you want to turn up the volume a bit for. We get to hear a pretty nice rumble from the Enzo?s 6.0-liter V-12...For the record, the Enzo started out in 2003 at $659,330. It was only produced in 299 examples, and this $2.15 million price tag is the highest I?ve seen in auctions so far. With that said, click play and enjoy the short video...Launched as a successor to the .. the .. was designed with a language that, according to the design team led by Flavio Manzoni, is the perfect combination of form and function. It combines ..inspired aerodynamics and plenty of sharp character lines to bring together one of the wildest production cars from .. On the inside, the LaFerrari got a newly-designed steering wheel that is more square than it is round, and an overall interior design that screams track-only but offers plenty of comfort two. The biggest news is what makes this red rocket go. The new LaFerrari is the first car from the brand to use a .. Known as the HY-KERS system, it has a 6.3-liter V-12 and two .. Total output is 963 horsepower (800 from the ICE and 163 from the electric motors) and more than 663 pound-feet of torque. To help keep everything kosher on the road, the suspension system has been designed specifically for the car, and Brembo brakes are in place to bring this puppy to a stop...Ferrari went above and beyond with the LaFerrari, with the exception of the name, but don?t even get me started on that one. Outside of the name, however, Ferrari is bringing a heavy hitter to a .. market that is now going hybrid. It is slated to compete against models like the wild .. and the .. ? both of which have plenty of hybrid DNA in their genes. So, what separates the goofy-named LaFerrari from the pack of hybrid heavy hitters? Check out our full review below and you?ll find out that and more... Ferrari brought a satin black 2014 LaFerrari at the 2016 Mecum Auctions sale during Monterey Car Week, where it was auction for the record price of $4.7 million.

The .. with Ludicrous Mode went first and it just wasn?t much of a contest as the Concept One quickly left it in behind. As awesome as the Tesla S, it?s just not on the same performance level as the Concept One, and that?s already taking into account the ..s 0-to-60-mph time of 2.8 seconds...Then it was the LaFerrari?s turn, in which case the result turned out to be the same.

      In China?s Car Market, Price Matters More Than Volume    - WSJ
    
http://www.wsj.com/articles/in-chinas-car-market-price-matters-more-than-volume-1451833006

Investors in China?s car market should watch out for too many cars and too low prices.

For all the attention investors pay to growth in the world?s largest car market, its future depends on price. And that isn?t looking pleasant...Car pricing was the salient issue in China?s auto market during the first half of 2015, as manufacturers supplied too many cars and had to cut prices.

Cadillac to slash ELR electric car price on 2016 model by $10,000 : TreeHugger
http://www.treehugger.com/cars/cadillac-slash-elr-electric-car-price-2016-model.html

Dealers are already heavily discounting it to try to spur slow sales.

Making sustainability sexy.... ....May 13, 2015..The Cadillac ELR is kind of the answer to the question: ..? It's GM's ambitious attempt to compete with Tesla in the high-end of the market where performance and luxury matter more, and while the ELR does have a .., it's starting to look like .. might have been too high...At $75,995, which drops to $68,495 after the $7,500 federal tax credit, the ELR had quite the sticker shock. That's probably GM is doing a significant price cut for the 2016 model year, dropping the MSRP to $58,495 after incentives, or $65,995 before them. Still high compared to the average car, but definitely more competitive against other vehicle in that category...In practice, the ELR is already selling around that point. According to TrueCar, a company that tracks that kind of thing, Cadillac dealers are already slashing prices by about $11,000 on average on the ELR. .. even reports that some dealerships around New York are selling the ELR for just under $50,000, "a whopping 35 percent discount from its sticker price."..This being Cadillac's first electric car (or more precisely, a plug-in hybrid), the company has a lot to learn about what the right pricing is, how to train dealers to sell it against its more conventional vehicles, etc...Interestingly, that Bloomberg article shows that the .. is selling above its MSRP on average. It's not clear if it's because demand is strong or because supply is so small, though...Under the hood, the centerpiece of the ELR is the T-shaped lithium-ion battery, like in the Volt. It can store 16.5 kWh of power, giving the plug-in Cadillac 35 miles (56 km) of 100%-electric driving range. After that, the 1.4-liter gasoline engine kicks in and powers the car. It will take about 4.5 hours to fully recharge the battery using a 240V outlet...Total output for the drivetrain is 207 hp (154 kW) with an impressive 295 lb.-ft (400 Nm) of instantly-available torque. It's this torque that makes electric vehicles so much fun!..The Cadillac ELR will meet California's Enhanced AT-PZEV emission standard, giving it access to high occupancy vehicle lanes. Always a nice perk...The battery, which you can see in blue below, will be covered by an eight-year/100,000-mile warranty...Here's the ELR playing in the snow:..Via ..Tags:.. |........Devotion knows no bounds when it comes to bees and their leader...by .. in Animals......Finally, schools are catching on to the fact that packed lunches generate far .....by .. in Green Food......How well do you know some of history's most influential environmental activists?..by .. in Conservation......Newly discovered documents reveal that Harvard scientists were paid to downplay sugar?s harm .....by .. in Green Food..COPYRIGHT ? 2016 ..

  How to Lease a Car and Get the Best Deal - Personal Finance - WSJ.com
http://guides.wsj.com/personal-finance/buying-a-car/how-to-lease-a-car/

To get the best deal on a car lease don?t tell a dealer you plan to lease until after you\'ve negotiated the car?s purchase price. Most people who lease are unaware that their monthly payments will be based on the final agreed-upon price.

A car lease lets you drive a new vehicle without paying a large sum of cash or taking out a loan...To lease a car, you simply make a small down payment ? less than the typical 20% of a car?s value you?d pay to buy? followed by monthly payments for the term of the lease. When the term expires, you return the car...Leasing a car has some drawbacks, however. Among them:..? You don?t own the car when your lease expires. You essentially rent, not buy, the car. So you don?t have equity in the car to use toward the purchase of another vehicle...? Over time, say 10 years, the cost of leasing several cars will likely exceed the purchase price of a new or used car...? Lease terms can carry steep penalties. You may have to pay penalties if:..-You exceed the number of miles in your lease contract...- You fail to keep the interior and exterior of the car in good condition...- You drive the car hard and inflict significant wear and tear on the car?s performance and appearance...- You want to return the car before your contract expires...Leasing is more beneficial than buying when you:..? Don?t have the cash to buy the car...? Want to drive a vehicle that?s out of your purchase price range...? Won?t likely exceed the mileage cap in a contract?usually between 10,000 and 15,000 miles per year...? Can take good care of the car?s exterior and interior, paying particular attention to avoid nicks, spills and other cosmetic damage...? Expect to lease another car when your vehicle?s current contract expires...Exceeding the mileage limits on your lease can cost you 10 to 15 cents per mile. The dealer will inspect your car just before the lease expires, and you?ll also be charged for excessive wear and tear...Leasing a car is less complicated than buying one. But to get the best deal on the car you want, you must still follow these steps:..? ..? What kind of car do you want? Better yet, what car do you need? A convertible? A sedan? An SUV?..? ..? Make a list of car types in your price range. You can reduce non-lease costs by including models with favorable gas mileage, high dependability, top safety features and low insurance premiums (ask your auto insurance agent for a list of vehicles that fit the bill)...? ..? Once you?ve narrowed your list to a few models, take each car for a test drive. Pay particular attention to comfort, visibility, braking, steering, internal noise and shock-absorption. At this stage, don?t yet mention you intend to lease (more on this in Step 6)...? ..? During your test drive, ask the salesperson whether the vehicle comes with anti-lock brake systems (ABS), electronic stability control (ESC) and head-protecting side air bags. All are valuable safety features...? ..? When you return home from the dealer, calculate the lease deals on offer and figure out how much you can afford to pay monthly...? ..? Once you?re ready to return to a dealership to strike a deal, don?t tell the dealer you plan to lease until .. you?ve negotiated a purchase price. Most people who lease are unaware that their monthly payments will be based on the final agreed-upon price...? ..? Negotiate the final price of the vehicle up from the rock-bottom cost to the dealership. You can find out what new cars cost a dealer for $14 per vehicle at ... Your monthly payments will be based on the price you and the salesperson settle on. That price will fall somewhere between the dealer?s wholesale price and the manufacturer?s suggested retail price...?..? Your salesperson may try to push you toward closing the deal by focusing on the relatively low amount you?ll have to pay each month. This, however, will add to the total amount you?ll pay...? ..? The larger your initial down payment, the lower your monthly tab will be. As with any bill, you?ll face penalties if you fail to make payments on time. Turning in your leased car early, before the loan term ends will typically result in a penalty?unless you are trading in the car for another leased or purchased car...facebook..Twitter..Digg..StumbleUpon..Viadeo..Orkut..Yahoo!?Buzz..Fark..reddit..LinkedIn..del.icio.us..MySpace..Your email has been sent...An error has occured and your email has not been sent. ..

Price Tracking - How Kelley Blue Book Works | HowStuffWorks
http://auto.howstuffworks.com/buying-selling/kelley-blue-book5.htm

Price Tracking - Kelley Blue Book price tracking is done by appraisers and data collection employees. Learn how Kelley Blue Book price tracking accounts for market changes.

Follow us......Follow us..?It isn't ?very difficult for Kelley to find the MSRP and dealer invoice prices for new cars. Although dealerships don't publicize their invoice prices, Kelley has relationships with manufacturers. The Blue Book value is another matter. Employees in Kelley's Data Collection division gather information from thousands of transactions at dealerships across the United States, analyze the data, and come up with a price that reflects the actual price that people pay when they buy their cars at a dealership...Kelley Blue Book doesn't provide a similar value for used cars, because there is no practical way to track used car sales. Many of these sales are between private individuals, so Kelley has no way of knowing actual selling prices. In this case, Kelley Blue Book applies its 75 years of car appraisal experience to determine prices. It starts with the value of the car when it was new and takes into account market forces that are in play at the time...Cars with good fuel efficiency are in demand right now, so they might fetch higher prices. The depreciation of a car's value is calculated based on previous model years, the quality of the car and the number of cars on the used car market. Common cars that were bought in bulk for rental company fleets command lower prices because the used car market is virtually flooded with them. High-quality cars, or cars that were made in limited quantities, receive a higher value. Cars known to have long-term mechanical problems will depreciate to a greater extent. Optional equipment, mileage, and the overall condition of the car will also affect the price...Kelley's retail price for used cars takes into account the dealer's cost to refurbish the car and make any repairs and general dealer overhead (such as paying salespeople, paying for advertising and keeping cars in inventory). The retail cost is higher than the private cost, since in a private sale you would sell the car as-is or take care of those things yourself. The trade-in value is lower for the same reason -- the dealer has to turn a profit after paying for those overhead costs...Are the Kelley values rock-solid? They are a good starting point and a good way to make sure that you aren't ripped off, but many variables can affect a car's value. If you have the only light blue 1998 Pontiac Grand Am for sale in the state, and someone really wants that specific car and color, you can probably get a better price than the Blue Book value. If a large number of similar vehicles are put up for sale in your area at the same time, prices will generally be lower than Blue Book. Although these variables are countless, they all follow the law of supply and demand -- the more people want something, and the fewer there are to buy, the more they'll be willing to pay for it...For more information on car price guides and related topics, check out the links on the next page...Kelley Blue Book isn't the only automotive price guide out there, although it has become synonymous with used car values.

Here?s How Electric Cars Will Cause the Next Oil Crisis
http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-ev-oil-crisis/

A shift is under way that will lead to widespread adoption of EVs in the next decade.

By Tom Randall | Feb. 25, 2016..With all good technologies, there comes a time when buying the alternative no longer makes sense. Think smartphones in the past decade, color TVs in the 1970s, or even gasoline cars in the early 20th century. Predicting the timing of these shifts is difficult, but when it happens, the whole world changes. ..It?s looking like the 2020s will be the decade of the electric car...Battery prices fell 35 percent last year and are on a trajectory to make unsubsidized electric vehicles as affordable as their gasoline counterparts in the next six years, according to a new analysis of the electric-vehicle market by Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF). That will be the start of a real mass-market liftoff for electric cars...By 2040, long-range electric cars will cost less than $22,000 (in today?s dollars), according to the projections. Thirty-five percent of new cars worldwide will have a plug. ..This isn?t something oil markets are planning for, and it?s easy to see why. Plug-in cars make up just one-tenth of 1 percent of the global car market today. They?re a rarity on the streets of most countries and still cost significantly more than similar gasoline burners. OPEC maintains that electric vehicles (EVs) will make up just 1 percent of cars in 2040. Last year ConocoPhillips Chief Executive Officer Ryan Lance told me EVs won?t have a material impact for another 50 years?probably not in his lifetime. ..But here?s what we know: In the next few years, Tesla, Chevy, and Nissan plan to start selling long-range electric cars in the $30,000 range. Other carmakers and tech companies are investing billions on dozens of new models. By 2020, some of these will cost less and perform better than their gasoline counterparts.  The aim would be to match the success of Tesla?s Model S, which now outsells its competitors in the large luxury class in the U.S. The question then is how much oil demand will these cars displace? And when will the reduced demand be enough to tip the scales and cause the next oil crisis?..First we need an estimate for how quickly sales will grow. ..Last year EV sales grew by about 60 percent worldwide. That?s an interesting number, because it?s also roughly the annual growth rate that Tesla forecasts for sales through 2020, and it?s the same growth rate that helped the .. cruise past the horse and buggy in the 1910s. For comparison, solar panels are following a similar curve at around 50 percent growth each year, while LED light-bulb sales are soaring by about 140 percent each year.  ..Yesterday, on the .. of Bloomberg?s new animated series .., we calculated the effect of continued 60 percent growth. We found that electric vehicles could displace oil demand of 2 million barrels a day as early as 2023. That would create a glut of oil equivalent to what triggered the 2014 oil crisis. ..Compound annual growth rates as high as 60 percent can?t hold up for long, so it?s a very aggressive forecast. BNEF takes a more methodical approach in its analysis today, breaking down electric vehicles to their component costs to forecast when prices will drop enough to lure the average car buyer. Using BNEF?s model, we?ll cross the oil-crash benchmark of 2 million barrels a few years later?in 2028...Predictions like these are tricky at best. The best one can hope for is to be more accurate than conventional wisdom, which in the oil industry is for little interest in electric cars going forward.  ..?If you look at reports like what OPEC puts out, what Exxon puts out, they put adoption at like 2 percent,? said Salim Morsy, BNEF analyst and author of today?s EV report. ?Whether the end number by 2040 is 25 percent or 50 percent, it frankly doesn?t matter as much as making the binary call that there will be mass adoption.?..BNEF?s analysis focuses on the total cost of ownership of electric vehicles, including things like maintenance, gasoline costs, and?most important?the cost of batteries. ..Batteries account for a third of the cost of building an electric car. For EVs to achieve widespread adoption, one of four things must happen: ..1. Governments must offer incentives to lower the costs...2.   Manufacturers must accept extremely low profit margins...3. Customers must be willing to pay more to drive electric. ..4.   The cost of batteries must come down. ..The first three things are happening now in the early-adopter days of electric vehicles, but they can?t be sustained. Fortunately, the cost of batteries is headed in the right direction...There?s another side to this EV equation: Where will all this electricity come from? By 2040, electric cars will draw 1,900 terawatt-hours of electricity, according to BNEF. That?s equivalent to 10 percent of humanity?s electricity produced last year. ..The good news is electricity is getting cleaner. .., the world has been adding more electricity-generating capacity from wind and solar than from coal, natural gas, and oil combined. Electric cars will reduce the cost of battery storage and help store intermittent sun and wind power. In the move toward a cleaner grid, electric vehicles and renewable power create a mutually beneficial circle of demand.  ..And what about all the lithium and other finite materials used in the batteries? BNEF analyzed those markets as well, and found they?re just not an issue. Through 2030, battery packs will require less than 1 percent of the known reserves of lithium, nickel, manganese, and copper. They?ll require 4 percent of the world?s cobalt. After 2030, new battery chemistries will probably shift to other source materials, making packs lighter, smaller, and cheaper...Despite all this, there?s still reason for oil markets to be skeptical. Manufacturers need to actually follow through on bringing down the price of electric cars, and there aren?t yet enough fast-charging stations for convenient long-distance travel. Many new drivers in China and India will continue to choose gasoline and diesel. Rising oil demand from developing countries could outweigh the impact of electric cars, especially if crude prices fall to $20 a barrel and stay there. ..The other unknown that BNEF considers is the rise of autonomous cars and ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft, which would all put more cars on the road that drive more than 20,000 miles a year. The more miles a car drives, the more economical battery packs become. If these new services are successful, they could boost electric-vehicle market share to 50 percent of new cars by 2040, according to BNEF. ..One thing is certain: Whenever the oil crash comes, it will be only the beginning. Every year that follows will bring more electric cars to the road, and less demand for oil. Someone will be left holding the barrel.

World's first 3D-printed car could cost you $53,000
http://mashable.com/2015/11/06/local-motors-pre-sale/

Local Motors, which claims to be the world's first 3D-printed carmaker, plans to offer pre-sales of its LM3D series starting in 2016.

Local Motors, the world's most prominent maker of 3D-printed cars, announced this week that it plans to offer pre-sales of its series of 3D printed models starting in spring 2016. It estimates the sticker price for the LM3D series, including the new  Swim model seen above, to be around the $53,000 mark...See also: ..The dune-buggy-like 3D-printed cars will be manufactured in a "microfactory" currently under construction in Knoxville, Tennessee. The company anticipates the production facility to be completed by the end of 2015. There, cars will be constructed "using direct digital manufacturing (DDM), of which 3D-printing is a part," according to a company .....If Local Motors meets that targeted timeline, it should be able to begin delivering cars to customers in early 2017...Ignoring the vast numbers of future promises and variables to this announcement, it's fairly significant. Although major carmakers like Audi are 3D printing things like 1:2-scale race car .. for fun, Local Motors will be the first company to offer (at least partially) 3D-printed cars for sale to the public...Image: Local Motors..Some of you might notice that the $53,000 estimated purchase price for the new LM3D series is a bit higher than the (estimated) $18,000 Strait model we .. this. That's because the Swim ? like the rest of the LM3D series ? is a "fully homologated, highway ready car," a Local Motors told .....Regardless, it'll be interesting to see if Local Motors can keep its proposed timeline. It will be even more interesting to see how many people line up for a $53k 3D-printed car. After all, for that money, buyers can get a 2016 Mercedes-Benz E-Class...Local Motors points out that the Swim a rapid iteration that showcases the advances the company has made. The final LM3D should have a lot more creature comforts that justify the sticker price. We'll have to wait and see... We added details about the Swim and the LM3D series.

http://www.cbg.ie/whats-it-worth

Are you looking to sell your car? Wondering what its worth? Try our FREE evaluation guide and Sell Your Car For FREE today, the only place you can sell car free.

When buying or selling a Car it is always useful to know how the current car value - how much        the Car in question is currently being bought or sold for elsewhere in Ireland. For this reason we have        devised .. - a way for you to find out, using live examples of Cars currently on sale,        to estimate how much you might sell or expect to pay for your Car...                Simply pick the MAKE and MODEL and the YEAR of the Car in question, hit GO and you        will be given an average price for your selected Car. It is then possible to view        the list of Cars from which the average was calculated. Remember that the results        are for guidance purposes only and when selling or buying a Car you will need to        be flexible.         ..        The average car value is made up of both dealer lists and privately owned Cars currently for        sale in Car Buyers Guide, our weekly magazine, and on our cbg.ie web site. Bear        in mind that the car price you see is often slightly higher than what you might pay        when you actually make it to the forecourt or the private sellers house - the actual car price will        depend on your negotiation skills!        ..www.cbg.ie Limited takes no responsibility for sellers not attaining these types        of car prices when selling their Cars or for purchasers not being able to purchase a        Car at these prices. Remember when most people sell their Car they put in a price        that they would most like to achieve. Be realistic and use the above .. for what it        is - guidance pricing only!

What are the best bargaining techniques when buying a car from a dealer? - Quora
https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-bargaining-techniques-when-buying-a-car-from-a-dealer

[]

Back in 2005-2007, I used to .. vehicles. I was the #2 top selling sales person at both of the stores of where I worked. When I was working at a high volume dealership, I was averaging about 23 vehicle sales a month. I felt that I could provide the insight necessary on what consumers could do to purchase vehicles with ease, from the seller?s perspective...Here are my best tips on negotiating the purchase of your next vehicle:..Your Sales Consultant is trained to focus on three of the boxes. First, your trade in. There is a 100% fact that you will not get the KBB pricing of the Fair Market Value for your vehicle. Why? Because Trade In prices are based off of what your car will sell for auction. In California, the standard is Manheim Auctions...The price you want to get for your trade in can?t be far fetched. Getting ?top dollar? for your vehicle as the ?Fair? or even ?Good? value is quite impossible at a dealership. Your best bet is to sell your car to Carmax, from where you will at least $1,000 more than the dealership?s top offer would be, or to sell your vehicle private party...The cost of the vehicle is next. This is usually something that the sales consultant does his best to avoid. He usually tries to push you back into the down payment or monthly payment areas to see what fits in your budget...Instead, focus strictly on the price. Ask to see the dealer?s cost sheet. The cost sheet will show the invoice price of the vehicle. (No, dealerships do not have two lists, one with fake pricing and one with the real pricing? They only have one?) Look at the invoice price. Your goal is to get them to sell you the vehicle at that price that is listed there or below it. If you go to a heavy volume dealership, your chances of getting the number under the invoice figure are much higher than at a low volume dealership. The high volume dealership can take the loss. The low volume dealership needs every penny they can get...Ignore the other two boxes completely. Don?t even look at the payment or down payment boxes. Instead, go to a credit union in your area to secure financing. The best two in California would be Kinecta Federal Credit Union or Lockheed?s Credit Union. They offer the absolute best rates. Unless you?re going for one of those 1.9% APR deals. Then that?s the way to go...Now, before anything, ask for a print out of an itemized break down of all the fees associated to the purchase of the vehicle. The only parts that should be filled out are the price of the vehicle, the taxes, and the fees associated to registration...There shouldn?t be a gap contract, an extended warranty, an alarm, or anything else...From here, you would agree upon the deal and enter the finance office...Now, it would be up to your discretion, if you decide to buy gap or any other type of insurances for your vehicle. Gap is usually presented at $795. You can get it for $395, but you may want to check with your lender first. Some lenders already build something like Gap into their contracts prior to financing you your vehicle, others don?t...If you decide that you need to buy an extended warranty for the vehicle, do it later. Wait until after you purchase the vehicle, call the manufacturer of your car directly, and buy the warranty from them. You will save yourself from paying for any unnecessary fees in the process...Then, you can leave the dealership with a brand new vehicle at the lowest price possible. Instead of having to negotiate, you have someone who knows the ins and outs of the business, your sales person, working for you for an extra $100. And last but not least, you will be able to get the deal of a lifetime...However, this is really only if you want to go through all the hassles of visiting a dealership and wasting about three to five hours of your life. Even the fastest deals I?ve pushed through straight to finance?. The shortest time I?ve ever had a customer in the office was three hours...My personal recommendation would be to skip going through any of these steps at all. Test drive the vehicle you want at a dealership. Leave. Locate an auto broker. An auto broker works for you, not the dealership. They do all the negotiating and the paperwork for you and they usually deliver the car straight to your home. All you have to do is tell them what you want, and they?ll work to achieve it. They?re experts in the field and they know how to get you the absolute best price possible. .. Some brokers are out for your best interest, and others want to make a small fortune off of you...Good luck on your journey to purchase a vehicle, and if you need any help or recommendations, feel free to reach out to me at any time!..I used to work at a heavy volume dealership. My customers who ended up entering the office late had to stick around in the finance office until 1:00AM in the morning! That meant I had to stick around until 1:00AM as well. I was always late to work every day because of people like this. There was no way in the world I could ever make it to work before 10:00AM. But then again, I was working 15 hour days and selling more than anyone else, so I guess that didn?t really matter to upper management...I?ve never sold a car for less than $250 under MSRP in the rain...If you?re dealing with a good sales person, they will make you go out with them in the rain to play with the vehicle and get drenched with you. Then when you go to negotiate, you?re going to feel bad for the poor fellow who got drenched in the rain and ruined his expensive suit just for you. Then you?ll pay top dollar, because we?re all emotional creatures who have hearts...Read more at my blog:

Apple Car Price
http://applecarfans.com/apple-car-price/

The price of the Apple Car will be greater than the average car sold and approaching the luxury range. ?Latest information about the Apple car price.

..........The Apple car price is everyone?s first question. ?Here we attempt to answer it...Despite the fact that the Apple car isn?t official and far from guaranteed and likely doesn?t exist in physical form, mention that Apple is building a car and the listener?s typical first response is ?how much is it??..This is true for any new product or new product category as these are consumer items and the consumer wants to know if they can afford it...Of course we don?t really know how much Apple?s first car is going to cost at the point of this writing in February 2016, however there is plenty of information we can use to deduce it...First, .. of a new car in the USA in ?December 2015 was $34,428. ?This if for the typical new light vehicle, and though the range is great spanning from compact budget cars through nigh end luxury models...We can assume as it always the Apple way, their car will be considerably?more than that...Another Apple strategy is to come out with a product so compelling and lustworthy people will pay for more than its worth in components, far more than it s closest competition. ?In so doing Apple usually expects smaller volumes in the first year with rapid future growth as prices come down slightly...For certain the car will be packed with breakthrough technology never before found in cars, like smart windshields, and this will add to the price...It seems unlikely the Apple car will compete on price points with high end luxury vehicles those close to or about the hundred thousand dollar mark, although the Model S is close around $80,000...Finally it is without question the Apple car will come in different feature package levels, like all cars do and akin to the strategy for iPhones or any other Apple device...It is likely the first Apple car will ?be of a single model and not several, and may be called the Apple car, Apple Titan or iCar seems unlikely...So what is the Apple car price?..Figure double the cost of the average car, in the mid luxury range and slightly below Tesla. ?Our guess ?$54,999-$64,999...Your email address will not be published... ...... .. ..Copyright  ? 2016 by Apple Car Fans

Price Hike From Maruti Suzuki Across All Models; Vitara Brezza Price Up By Rs 20,000 - NDTV CarAndBike
http://auto.ndtv.com/news/price-hike-from-maruti-suzuki-across-all-models-vitara-brezza-price-up-by-rs-20-000-1438851

Maruti Suzuki has increased prices on all its models. The Japanese carmaker has announced prices will be going up with immediate effect. The quantum of increase is Rs 1500-5000 on most models, but its two bestsellers have the larger hikes. The newest car in the Maruti portfolio, the subcompact SUV Vitara Brezza has a Rs 20,000 price hike which is quite steep.

 has increased prices on all its models. The Japanese carmaker has announced prices will be going up with immediate effect. The quantum of increase is Rs 1500-5000 on most models, but its two bestsellers have the larger hikes. The newest car in the Maruti portfolio, the subcompact SUV Vitara Brezza has a Rs 20,000 price hike which is quite steep. Maruti though says that it had launched the .. in March at an introductory price and so this hike was imminent. The .. premium hatchback's price has been upped by Rs 10,000...This is the second price increase by the country's largest carmaker. The last time Maruti Suzuki increased prices was in January - and at the time too the maximum increase was Rs 20,000 (which was on the Baleno). In January Maruti had blamed rising input costs for the hike. The Union Budget had also sparked off a round of price hikes this year - when Maruti had also increased prices across the board (by Rs 1400-35,000) as a result of the infrastructure cess imposed by the government...This time around , the company cites forex movement and strategic product decisions as reasons for the hikes. This is the fourth price increase by Maruti in the past 12 month period. Most other manufacturers are likely to take a cue from Maruti, since they largely tend to hold off on any price hike considerations, until the market leader bites the bullet. In January too Hyundai had announced an up to Rs 30,000 price hike soon after Maruti. We expect more announcements to follow from the rest of the car brigade in the next few days...&COPY; Copyright Fifth Gear Ventures Ltd 2016. All rights reserved.
